Hawthorne rolled over in bed and looked around the room.  He let out a breath. His eyes were half-closed as he shoved the covers back from his bed, and moved towards the door.  He knew that he had to check on Kate, if he did nothing else. She was ill, with a heart problem, and he worried about her all the time.  They both lived in a home for orphans, and he had since his parents had died, when he was the age of four. He had taken care of Kate as if she were his sister ever since. He wandered to her room sitting himself by her on her bed, shoving her hair from her face.  She moved on the bed as he pulled her into his arms, "Kate." He said into her ear, "It's time to wake up." He pressed a kiss to her head, and her eyes opened.  "Hawthy?" She said, her nickname for him moving from her lips.  "Yea." He moved her hair.  "I want to go outside today," she said, and he nodded in response.  "If you are up to it, I won't stop you", he told her, and she smiled.  "Thanks Hawthy", she said.  It wasn't long until she fell back to sleep.

One night I was at my friend's house where he threw a party. We were enjoying our dinner at night when all of a sudden we heard a knock on the door. I opened the door and saw this guy who had scar on his face. I asked my friend "who is that guy?", and he told me that it was his friend. I didn't trust that guy because he looked very strange.  After we had dinner the strange guy asked my friend to come outside because he wanted to talk to him. A few seconds later I heard a noise from outside and when I ran outside I saw that the strange guy was trying to beat my friend. I ran towards him and asked him to leave our house. He left the house but after half an hour he came back and this time he was dressed up as superhero and he also had a sword. As soon as I saw him I ran inside the house and called the cops. The cops came and the guy ran away as soon as he heard the cop car coming. We never found out what happened to that guy after that day.

Two best friends lived in a small town. They grew up together and did everything together. One boy was named James, and he was a cute, fat kid who was always picked on. And then the other boy was named Alex, and he was handsome and cool. They were opposites, but they didn't care. Alex would always protect James from the bullies because James was weak.  One day, James was being teased by the bullies, Gordon and Johnny, but Alex wasn't there to save him. James didn't know what to do and was scared. But then he remembered all of the times Alex stood up for him. James looked up to Alex and he thought of him as his hero. James wanted to protect himself and not have Alex always come to help. So this time, James got up and was brave. He stood up to Gordon and Johnny and told them that he wasn't scared. The bullies didn't know what to do and then gave up.

They still are the best of friends.

One day, James was being teased by the bullies, Gordon and Johnny, but Alex wasn't there to save him. James didn't know what to do and was scared. But then he remembered all of the times Alex stood up for him. James looked up to Alex and he thought of him as his hero. James wanted to protect himself and not have Alex always come to help. So this time, James got up and was brave. He stood up to Gordon and Johnny and told them that he wasn't scared. The bullies didn't know what to do and then gave up. They went away to look for more fun things to do. Alex saw the whole thing and was proud of James for being brave.  Now James and Alex protect each other and stand up for each other. They still are the best of friends.
Johnny is the character that is fat and is being bullied.

One sunny day, Martha went on a walk through the park. While walking, she noticed something strange. No one was outside. She was the only person at the park. "How strange, where is everyone?" she thought. Martha looked everywhere. She looked inside the restrooms, under the benches, and even at the top of the slide. She was confused. Usually, she would see her friends playing with each other. She started walking again when one of her friends popped up, surprising her. Her friend asked her, "Why are you outside?" Martha asked what she meant, and explained that she always came out to the park to play. Her friend then looked at her strangely and asked, "Didn't Stephan invite you to his party?" Martha hadn't known that Stephan was holding a party. She was sad that he hadn't invited her. She walked back home, upset.
The park didn't invite Martha to the party.

In a far away land known as Board, there was a great man named Pawn. This was a very odd land because the only thing to do was play chess. Pawn did not very much care for chess as he was very bored with it. Another problem Pawn had was that he didn't like some of the other people in this land. They had names like Bishop, Queen, Rook, and Knight. And most of all, there was King. He was the greatest person in Board. One day, during their normal battle, Pawn saw an opening to move to the far end of Board. He almost got hurt by Knight but he got away. Amazingly, when he got to the other end he became as powerful as Queen. With this amazing power, Pawn chose to help keep King safe. All was well until Pawn woke up and knew that it was only a dream. He was still Pawn.
Pawn almost hurt Pawn.

Jake wanted to eat an orange.  He liked fruit, and the only fruits in the house were apples, which he didn't like, oranges, and strawberries, which made him itchy.  But his mother had put oranges on top of the refrigerator.   Jake couldn't reach the top of the refrigerator.  He got the stool that he used to reach things in the cupboards.   But the stool wasn't tall enough on its own.  He thought if he stood on the edge of the kitchen sink he could reach the oranges.  (The kitchen sink was right next to the refrigerator). So he used the stool to get up to the edge of the sink, and then he stood on the edge of the sink to get the oranges.  He took one out of the bag and then put the bag back on top of the refrigerator.  Then he used the stool to climb back down again with his orange.  He sat at the kitchen table, peeled the orange, and ate it.  Then he took all of the pieces of orange peel and threw them away in the yard waste.
doesn't using the stool work at first because It isn't tall enough.

Usually a week is not enough time to get pretty good at baseball but James is practicing so much he is fitting a month of practice into one week.  Then James has a setback.  His glove rips during practice.  He can't keep playing with a broken glove!  So Tommy and James go around town collecting bottles to trade in for five cents for each bottle.  James misses a day of practicing but they find enough bottles to turn in for thirty dollars.  This is enough money for James to buy a new glove!  So James buys a new glove and he and Tommy go back to the field and practice some more.  By the time the season comes James is one of the best players on his team.

James thinks this is enough practice for him to catch up and be a good player when the season starts.  So James and Tommy practice every day.  They throw the ball around.  They practice batting and they practice fielding.  Tommy begins to see that James is getting better every day.

Flying a kite can be dangerous. When I was eight years old I went to the park with my dad to fly my new kite. We stood on the top of a hill and tried to catch the wind. It took us almost half an hour, but we finally got the kite into the air. As it lifted into the sky, the kite caught the edge of my jacket and I was pulled up into the wind with the kite. I flew higher and higher into the air until I my dad looked like an ant on the ground. The park was beautiful from up high, and I could see our car getting smaller. I flew all the way out of the city and over the lake. Eventually, the wind started to die down and I fell closer to the water. I called out to some people on a boat and they sailed over so I could land on their boat. I told them about my adventure and they sailed me back to land, where my dad picked me up. He took me out for ice cream and we went home.
Her father was the main character flying a kite with.

The first grade class went on a bus to visit a farm. The farm was a long ways from their school. The farm was also far away from any other farms or houses. The farmers who lived there were the Nixon family. They grew corn. Sometimes when the weather was right, they would plant wheat, too. The fields were so large that the class could not see where they ended. Mr. Nixon gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor. The Nixon family also had a lot of farm animals. In the red barn next to their home, they kept a few cows and horses. Everyone fed hay to some of the cows. The farmers got milk from their cows. Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them. All the kids got to ride on the big brown horses the Nixons had. They went up into the nearby hills, where they could look down on the farm below. Around the farmyard there were many goats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished. The Nixon children liked to play with their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did with their dogs and cats. The smallest tried to bump the children with their hard heads and tiny horns! When it was almost dark, the school kids got back on the bus to go home. They were a little sad to leave the fun life of the farm children. But they brought back stories for all the rest of the school to hear.
some of the class get to took home, other than stories corn.

I used to be afraid of butterflies!  It is true!  Once, my mom took me to Seattle.  There, we went to a special place.  We went to the zoo!  I saw lots of animals at the zoo.  I saw bears.  I saw tigers.  I saw apes.  I saw monkeys.  I saw snakes.  I loved seeing all these animals.  They made me happy.  We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn't even scare me.  In fact, I like bugs.  But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there were lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.  You could buy sugar water to feed them and they could land on you.  My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but I was scared.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying everywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They said butterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the room.  Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door! The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I was sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there!  I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.  Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.  They would try and get me to not be afraid.  Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.  She bought one for my brother, too.  I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find butterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on me and I laughed.  I liked it.  It tickled me.  It did not hurt me.  Now, I like butterflies!

I wasn't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying everywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They said butterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the room.  Guess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door! The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I was sorry, but I was scared.  He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there!  I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.  Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.  They would try and get me to not be afraid.  Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.  She bought one for my brother, too.  I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find butterflies with my brother.  It became really fun to do.  Once, a butterfly landed on me and I laughed.  I liked it.  It tickled me.  It did not hurt me.  Now, I like butterflies!

There was once a small town by a river. There were many houses in this town and they were all different colors, shapes and sizes. which made the people happy.

When the people of the town went out they loved to wear hats but never wore shoes and the hats were also many different colors, shapes and sizes. On Sundays all the families in town would go to the park by the river and have picnics. The children would run, skip and play and the parents would talk, eat and laugh. The children loved the picnic foods they had. There were hot dogs, hamburgers, chicken and steak. They also had salads, coleslaw, fries and chips. The kids' favorite was hamburgers with fries.  On days when it rained the children and parents would stay inside and read or color pictures and drink hot chocolate and they loved to wear big warm sweaters. At night the family would all go to the kitchen and cook dinner together and after dinner was finished they would all clear the table and clean the dishes together before getting ready for bed. They would put their pajamas on but never wear socks and they would get under the covers and fall asleep.

Chocolate was a box turtle.  Lauren found her one day on the side of the road, hiding in her old, worn shell, frightened by the cars going by.  Lauren picked Chocolate up to help her cross the street, because Lauren knew that turtles are very slow and cars are very fast.  After Lauren got Chocolate to the other side of the road, Chocolate peeked her head out of her shell and looked at the little girl.  Lauren saw that not only was Chocolate's shell worn, one of her eyes was shut.  Lauren thought Chocolate needed more help from her, so Lauren took the turtle home.  Lauren hid Chocolate in her bathtub, because she was worried that her mother would be mad. Lauren went to look up what turtles like to eat and left Chocolate alone in the bathtub.  Lauren was still looking up  turtle facts when she heard her mother call out, "Lauren, get in here now!"  Lauren knew she was in trouble.  But when Lauren came into the bathroom, her mother was smiling.  Lauren's mom told her that she had a turtle when she was a little girl.  Lauren and her mom took Chocolate to an animal doctor who treated sick turtles.  The doctor gave them special drops to put in Chocolate's eyes.  Lauren put the drops in Chocolate's eyes, like the doctor told her and soon the turtle's eyes were all better. Chocolate's shell was still old and worn looking, like an old shoe, but now her eyes were beautiful, like the golden jewels on Grandma's earrings. Lauren was glad that she helped Chocolate.

But when Lauren came into the bathroom, her mother was smiling.  Lauren's mom told her that she had a turtle when she was a little girl.  Lauren and her mom took Chocolate to an animal doctor who treated sick turtles.  The doctor gave them special drops to put in Chocolate's eyes.  Lauren put the drops in Chocolate's eyes, like the doctor told her and soon the turtle's eyes were all better. Chocolate's shell was still old and worn looking, like an old shoe, but now her eyes were beautiful, like the golden jewels on Grandma's earrings. Lauren was glad that she helped Chocolate.

He missed the next pitch too.  It was too fast.  He was ready for the next pitch.  He hit it hard to center field.  The Tiger player in center field jumped to catch it, but it went over his head and over the fence.  It was a home run!  The Knights won the game!

There was once a land named Catatonia where cats ran things. Cats walked and talked much as you do except they walked on four legs. There were cat policemen, cat firemen, cat teachers, and even a cat bus driver. Most of the cats were very busy.     The King of Catatonia was a small cat named Diggs. He had two brothers named Pouncer and Flash who helped him rule in Catatonia. Pouncer was head of the Milk, Cheese and Cream center and Flash's job was to blow things up. Together the three of them made sure all the cats were happy, had plenty to drink and got to enjoy bright fireworks shows in the distance.      One day Pouncer's wife brought the kittens to see Pouncer at his office. There were white kittens and lots of black and white spotted kittens walking around in the Milk, Cheese and Cream center.

There once was a big black and white dog named Forrest. His owner's name was Jeff. Jeff thought he was the best dog in the whole world.  One night, when Forrest and Jeff were taking a walk in the park, they saw two men walking down the path. Both men were dressed in very nice suits.  Jeff waved at the men.   "Good evening," he said. "How are you tonight?"  "Hello," one of the men said. "It is such a great night for walking."  Jeff and Forrest kept walking down the path. It was a very dark night, but the moon was shining bright. When Jeff turned around to look for the two men, he could not see them at all. They were nowhere to be seen.  Later that night, when their walk was over, Jeff and Forrest were lying on the bed. They were watching a television show about ghosts.  "Do you think maybe those two men were ghosts?" Jeff said out loud. "They did not leave a trace."  Forrest was a dog, but he acted like he understood. He barked.  Jeff smiled. He liked that his dog always saw things the same way he did.

One night, when Forrest and Jeff were taking a walk in the park, they saw two men walking down the path. Both men were dressed in very nice suits.  Jeff waved at the men.   "Good evening," he said. "How are you tonight?"  "Hello," one of the men said. "It is such a great night for walking."  Jeff and Forrest kept walking down the path. It was a very dark night, but the moon was shining bright. When Jeff turned around to look for the two men, he could not see them at all. They were nowhere to be seen.  Later that night, when their walk was over, Jeff and Forrest were lying on the bed. They were watching a television show about ghosts.  "Do you think maybe those two men were ghosts?" Jeff said out loud. "They did not leave a trace."  Forrest was a dog, but he acted like he understood. He barked.  Jeff smiled. He liked that his dog always saw things the same way he did.

Mary was a little girl who loved to sew. She liked to sew dresses, shirts, and skirts but Mary hated to sew quilts. She didn't like anything about sewing quilts and blankets because it took too long. One quilt or blanket took a week to make, when a skirt or shirt took one night! Mary's mother didn't understand why Mary didn't like to sew quilts and blankets because Mary's mother loved to!  Mary was a normal little girl even if her friends didn't think so all the time. Mary's friends liked to play games and play outside but all Mary liked was to sew. She woke up and she began to sew. She only stopped to eat and use the bathroom. Mary's father was very worried about Mary. He said that little girls needed to laugh and play, not sew all the time.   One day Mary's father took Mary's sewing things and gave them to the poor children. "No more sewing, Mary!" He said. He wanted her to go laugh and play with her friends instead of sew but instead of going outside to play she ran into her room and cried. Mary was very sad that she couldn't sew any more. Soon her friends came over to see why Mary hadn't come over to play like her father said she would. When they saw her crying on her bed they had to think of a way to cheer her up. Billy said that maybe they could let her sew at their houses. Abby thought it was a great idea. So then all Mary's friends bought sewing things with their money so that Mary would be happy again. When Mary's father saw Mary go to one of her friend's house he was very happy. Soon everyone was happy again.
Mary liked to sew blankets, dresses, and shirts.

Soon her friends came over to see why Mary hadn't come over to play like her father said she would. When they saw her crying on her bed they had to think of a way to cheer her up. Billy said that maybe they could let her sew at their houses. Abby thought it was a great idea. So then all Mary's friends bought sewing things with their money so that Mary would be happy again. When Mary's father saw Mary go to one of her friend's house he was very happy. Soon everyone was happy again.
two of Mary's friends' names are Jenny and Billy.

Cindy and Mary were playing at recess. They were having a great time until Cindy brought up Allison's birthday party. Cindy had been invited to it, but Mary had not. This hurt Mary's feelings a lot. The girls kept on playing and Mary was trying to have fun, but all she felt like doing was crying. She couldn't believe that she had not been invited to Allison's birthday party. She thought that they were friends and if her best friend Cindy had been invited, why not her?  After recess was over, the class walked back into the school. Mary saw Allison in line and tried to smile, but it was hard. Cindy felt horrible now that she had talked about the party that her friend was not going to.  Mary found it hard to pay attention to the teacher now. She kept thinking over and over why Allison didn't invite her to the party. Did Mary do something to make Allison mad or to hurt her? She couldn't understand it. Her eyes started to get wet with tears. She was hoping that no one saw this. Mary thought she saw Allison looking at her in a funny way. Suddenly Mary felt like she was going to start crying. She reached into her desk to pull out some tissues. She felt a strange  piece of paper. She pulled it out and there was the invitation to Allison's party. It had gotten mixed up in her papers in her desk. She immediately started to smile. She smiled at Allison and at Cindy. Cindy gave her a puzzled look because she thought that Mary was sad.   At lunch Mary explained everything to Cindy. Then Mary, Allison, and Cindy all went off to play.

Mary found it hard to pay attention to the teacher now. She kept thinking over and over why Allison didn't invite her to the party. Did Mary do something to make Allison mad or to hurt her? She couldn't understand it. Her eyes started to get wet with tears. She was hoping that no one saw this. Mary thought she saw Allison looking at her in a funny way. Suddenly Mary felt like she was going to start crying. She reached into her desk to pull out some tissues. She felt a strange  piece of paper. She pulled it out and there was the invitation to Allison's party. It had gotten mixed up in her papers in her desk. She immediately started to smile. She smiled at Allison and at Cindy. Cindy gave her a puzzled look because she thought that Mary was sad.   At lunch Mary explained everything to Cindy. Then Mary, Allison, and Cindy all went off to play.

She can give back her birthdays! But she didn't want to bring back any dinosaurs back by accident. Like last time.  Then an angel flew down from a star called the Pleiades to help her. His name was Eh. He said, "close your eyes! Then remember the most happy you have ever felt! Let go of any thing that feels like clouds. Imagine puppies hugging you, and kitties purring with you. Imagine you are eating chocolate ice cream!  As long as you remember how to be happy  you can ALWAYS be as young as Eduardo! And you can think of GREAT ways you can see him again!"  It worked!

Once upon a time, there was a boy named Freddy.   And Freddy loved his mom very much, and his mom loved him very much too.  One day, Freddy went outside to ride his bike.  On the way out, his mother told him, "Remember to wear your helmet," and Freddy grabbed his helmet and met his friends outside.  When he was putting on his helmet, his friends told him, "Helmets are for girls!  You're not cool if you wear a helmet!"  Freddy thought about what his mom told him, but he wanted to be cool like his friends, and he took off his helmet.  Freddy and his friends went on a long adventure, and they rode all the way to the top of the largest hill in their neighborhood.  Looking down, Freddy was scared.  He had never ridden down this hill before.  His friends said, "What are you, scared?"  Freddy did not want to come off as scared.  He hopped on his bicycle, and down he went.  Freddy started speeding up, going very, very fast.  He pressed his brakes, but oh no, his brakes weren't working.  Freddy, speeding down the hill, did not know what to do.  He got to the end of the hill and slammed right into a tree.  He awoke the next day in the hospital.  At the hospital, his mother was there.  Freddy opened his eyes and told his mom the whole story.  He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his helmet.  His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right in the beginning.  She didn't have to say it.  In the end, Freddy learned that it's important to not care what other people think, and those that think you're not cool because you wear a helmet are the ones that aren't cool in the first place.

He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his helmet.  His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right in the beginning.  She didn't have to say it.  In the end, Freddy learned that it's important to not care what other people think, and those that think you're not cool because you wear a helmet are the ones that aren't cool in the first place.
the main character's friends say to him "Freddy is a girl!" and "You're a little baby!".
Once upon a time, there was a boy named Freddy.   And Freddy loved his mom very much, and his mom loved him very much too.  One day, Freddy went outside to ride his bike.  On the way out, his mother told him, "Remember to wear your helmet," and Freddy grabbed his helmet and met his friends outside.  When he was putting on his helmet, his friends told him, "Helmets are for girls!  You're not cool if you wear a helmet!"  Freddy thought about what his mom told him, but he wanted to be cool like his friends, and he took off his helmet.  Freddy and his friends went on a long adventure, and they rode all the way to the top of the largest hill in their neighborhood.  Looking down, Freddy was scared.  He had never ridden down this hill before.  His friends said, "What are you, scared?"  Freddy did not want to come off as scared.  He hopped on his bicycle, and down he went.

The other day Mitch went to the store to buy his mother a big turkey. Inside the store there was food all over! Mitch could not believe his own little eyes. From the first time Mitch woke up this morning he knew that he'd be a big man someday, and getting a big turkey for his mother was the way in which he could show that he is a big man. The store had all kinds of food from chocolate bars to yummy radish. Mitch ran for the turkey section of the store with much force. "Turkeys are good, yummy yummy in my tummy, I want to eat a big old turkey and then go to the bathroom several times!" Mitch would cry out to strangers he met in the turkey section of the store. Then, four and a half seconds later, Mitch turned into a giant Walrus named Ted! No one knew how this could have happened, but the Walrus knew. A few years later, Mitch the now giant Walrus named Ted joined the circus and became a rich man with green in his heart. He could not think of anything else but making more money at his circus. One day Ted the giant Walrus, also known as Mitch the happy boy, remembered that his mother still wanted a big turkey for her late night breakfast. Now that Ted was a giant walrus making money hand over fist, he could buy his mommy a big old turkey for their night time breakfast. Ted the walrus also remembered that he had earlier built a time machine. Ted the giant walrus used his time machine to go back in time to buy his mother who was now a dog named Herbert. Ted's mother, Herbert loved the big turkey, but there was a small problem. Herbert the dog didn't have any teeth!

Alpha told him that the old books said to go in the blue door. This is why it was so hard for Alpha right now. Two doors were blue. Being a good leader, Alpha asked everyone what they wanted to do. The final choice was door D. They went in and enjoyed all of time in a world with odd colors.

Tommy's birthday is next week.  He is hoping for a very special gift.  What are some things Tommy is hoping for?  He would like a big, bouncy ball, like his friends Bobby and Joey have.  One with blue stripes!  He would really like some new sneakers.  Danny, Tommy's best friend, got a special pair of sneakers for HIS birthday last month.  They have pictures of robots on them and even light up when you walk!  He would really, REALLY like a shiny new bicycle.  Tommy has an old bicycle now. He is getting too big for it.  He saw a red one in the store yesterday when he was shopping with his Mom.  It looked like it was the right size for him!  But what Tommy wants most of all is a new baby brother.  Today his Mom and Dad said that he might have one very, very soon.  Then Tommy and his little brother can have many fun birthdays together.  That would be the best gift of all!

Tommy's birthday is next week.  He is hoping for a very special gift.  What are some things Tommy is hoping for?  He would like a big, bouncy ball, like his friends Bobby and Joey have.  One with blue stripes!  He would really like some new sneakers.  Danny, Tommy's best friend, got a special pair of sneakers for HIS birthday last month.  They have pictures of robots on them and even light up when you walk!  He would really, REALLY like a shiny new bicycle.  Tommy has an old bicycle now. He is getting too big for it.  He saw a red one in the store yesterday when he was shopping with his Mom.  It looked like it was the right size for him!  But what Tommy wants most of all is a new baby brother.

Once upon a time there were three rabbits, named Winston, Chester, and Francis. Chester was a brown rabbit with large eyes. Francis was grey and white and had messy fur. Winston was black and very fat. They were very happy rabbits who loved to eat. Every day they would leave their home, cross a road, and go through a small forest to get to a meadow of grass. They loved to eat that grass. One day, Chester thought he smelled something interesting. At first he thought it might be dirt. Then he thought maybe some sort of flower. So, he asked a nearby squirrel. The squirrel's name was Acorn. Acorn said that he thought it was mushrooms. However, Francis, the smartest rabbit, went to go look, and he learned that it was actually a garden of carrots. The rabbits were all excited. They all loved carrots! They ate all the carrots.

Late in the evening, the wind blew hard around the little house. The sound of the wind is like someone crying. It made the old woman nervous. She had not been getting much sleep lately, but with the wind making the spooky noise, she didn't know what else to do but lie down and try to rest a little.  Once she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept her mind busy. She still was having trouble falling asleep. She remembered being a little girl and her dad putting the finishing touches on the house. Her mom loved the big kitchen, and she and her younger sister had their own room in the back.  It was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep. The crying sound got louder. It didn't seem like it was outside. It sounded like it was coming from the other side of the bed. When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister. She still looked five years old. The old woman couldn't remember her any other way, as she had died from a sickness at age five.  "What's wrong?" she asked her sister. "I miss you. I am so lonely," answered the little girl, who was so thin you could see through her. The old lady closed her eyes and reached for her sister. That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling.  "She died in her sleep." "It is best that way."

That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling.  "She died in her sleep." "It is best that way."

Bailey and her friend Kara were bored one Saturday.  It was a hot summer day.  They didn't want to stay inside any longer but they didn't know what to do.  They were tired of watching TV inside.  Suddenly, Kara had an idea.  She said, "Bailey, we could make some money."  "How?," asked Bailey.  "Well, it is hot outside," said Kara. "People are thirsty out there.  We could make money by making some lemonade and iced tea and have people pay for it."  "That is a great idea," answered Bailey, "let's do it!" Kara had made some iced tea with her mom earlier that day.  She asked her mom permission to use it.  Her mom said yes.  She and Kara made two pitchers of lemonade.  They got a cooler full of ice and made a sign so people knew what was for sale.  Kara's mom helped them get a table and chairs and set up out on the corner in their neighborhood.  It was so hot out that people who saw their stand came to buy drinks right away. Their first visitors to their stand were their friends, Abby and Molly.  In a half hour, they had to close their stand. They were all out of lemonade and iced tea.  They had made a lot of money. They split the money and each got ten dollars.  It was a great day.

Two kittens were playing. They had come in from outside. Now they were in the living room in the house. One kitten was named Snowball and one kitten was named Fuzzy. Suddenly, Snowball saw something interesting.  "Look at that!" said Snowball.  "What is it?" asked Fuzzy.  "It's a ball of yarn. On the top shelf!" said Snowball. She had seen the yarn that was kept in a basket up there!  "That looks like it's fun to play with!" said Fuzzy. "But how could we get to it? It's so high up," he wondered.  "I have an idea," said Snowball. "Watch this!" Suddenly, Snowball jumped up on to the couch.  "What are  you doing?" asked Fuzzy.  "Just watch!" said Snowball. Snowball then jumped to the table next to the couch. Then, she jumped to the middle shelf.  "That's dangerous!" said Fuzzy. Snowball and Fuzzy were still small kittens. They weren't used to jumping very high yet.  "Don't worry, I'll be careful. I think we're allowed to be up here." said Snowball. Then, she jumped all the way to the top shelf, where the yarn was. "Look out below!" she yelled, and pushed the ball of yarn off the shelf and on to the floor.  "Whoa!" said Fuzzy. "Thanks!" Snowball then jumped down to the middle shelf, and down to the table, and down to the couch, and back to the floor. There, she and her brother played with the ball of yarn until they got tired and took a nap.
it dangerous for Snowball to get the ball of yarn because Balls of yarn are dangerous for kittens to play with.

They weren't used to jumping very high yet.  "Don't worry, I'll be careful. I think we're allowed to be up here." said Snowball. Then, she jumped all the way to the top shelf, where the yarn was. "Look out below!" she yelled, and pushed the ball of yarn off the shelf and on to the floor.  "Whoa!" said Fuzzy. "Thanks!" Snowball then jumped down to the middle shelf, and down to the table, and down to the couch, and back to the floor.

They put Bobby's backpack on a rack in the guest room.  Then Bobby and his grandmother went out for a walk.  They stopped at a corner shop for pizza and sodas.  Then they walked to the Empire State Building.  At the top of the Empire State Building they looked out over the city.  They counted all the bridges and looked at all the tall buildings.  Bobby bought three postcards and a little snow globe in the shop. Then they took the elevator back to the ground floor.  Next they took a yellow cab to Central Park.  They rode the carousel and went to the zoo.  Bobby's favorite animals were the monkeys.  He did not like the snakes at all.  After they had ice cream cones, Bobby and his grandmother took the train back to her school.  They had salads for supper.  Then they read a story together. Bobby's grandmother made up her sofa bed for Bobby as they made plans for the next day. Bobby wanted to know if they could go to a baseball game.  His grandmother said she would get tickets.
Bobby's grandmother say she would try to got Zoo tickets.

The best afternoon I ever had with my grandfather was when we went down to the river and fished.  It was a hot July day, and I was bored. My grandfather was sitting in the backyard, reading. "Hey, you look like you need some fun," he said.  "Want to go fishing?" I said sure, and he went to the garage.  He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some fishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together.  I asked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river.  It was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used to catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner.  When we got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned and walked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees right at the edge of the park. There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water. Then we sat down to wait. While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about what he and Steve did as kids. We didn't have any worms, so we never caught any fish, but sitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon.

On a snowy winter morning, the brown-haired lady saw a squirrel that was hurt. It only had three legs, and it looked hungry. She put some corn out for the squirrel to eat, but other bully squirrels came, too. The brown-haired lady started giving the little squirrel peanuts to eat. She gave some to the bully squirrels, too, so they would leave the three-legged squirrel alone.  The winter snow melted and then it was spring. The grass turned green and the air was warm. Now, when the little squirrel with three legs would come to see the brown-haired lady with the peanuts, it would take the peanuts and dig a little hole and hide the peanuts for later. The squirrel would hold the peanut in its mouth and dig and dig and dig, and then it would put the peanut in the hole and pat it down with its little front paw. Then it would run back over to the brown-haired lady and get some more peanuts to eat.

Tim Goes To The Beach  Today was exciting. Tim's mom was taking him and his little sisters, Rebecca and Georgia, to the beach! They were going to go swimming. Then they were also going to have a picnic lunch on the beach. After their picnic lunch, Tim's mom was going to light a campfire and they were going to eat toasted marshmallows.  Tim and his mom and his two little sisters hopped into the van. His little sisters were both very blonde and pretty little girls. They were only 4 years old. Because they lived in the city, they had a short drive to get to the beach. To pass the time, Tim played Eye Spy with his mother as they drove for a bit. Once they had gotten bored with Eye Spy, they played 20 Questions. Tim would think of something, and his mother would ask him questions to try and guess what it was.  When they got to the beach, it was warm, and sunny. The salt water was warm, and the waves lapped up on the shore. It made a lovely noise. It also felt great on Tim's toes, and his little sisters giggled when the waves hit them.  When they had had their fill of swimming, Tim's mom had them sit down to a nice dinner. They ate and ate. They ate macaroni salad. Then they ate some cold chicken. They also had lemon pie for dessert.  Tim's mom started a fire, and they spent the rest of the evening as the sun set eating toasted marshmallows and singing campfire songs. Tim thought it was a very good day.

Tim Goes To The Beach  Today was exciting. Tim's mom was taking him and his little sisters, Rebecca and Georgia, to the beach! They were going to go swimming. Then they were also going to have a picnic lunch on the beach. After their picnic lunch, Tim's mom was going to light a campfire and they were going to eat toasted marshmallows.  Tim and his mom and his two little sisters hopped into the van. His little sisters were both very blonde and pretty little girls. They were only 4 years old. Because they lived in the city, they had a short drive to get to the beach. To pass the time, Tim played Eye Spy with his mother as they drove for a bit. Once they had gotten bored with Eye Spy, they played 20 Questions. Tim would think of something, and his mother would ask him questions to try and guess what it was.  When they got to the beach, it was warm, and sunny. The salt water was warm, and the waves lapped up on the shore. It made a lovely noise. It also felt great on Tim's toes, and his little sisters giggled when the waves hit them.  When they had had their fill of swimming, Tim's mom had them sit down to a nice dinner. They ate and ate. They ate macaroni salad. Then they ate some cold chicken. They also had lemon pie for dessert.  Tim's mom started a fire, and they spent the rest of the evening as the sun set eating toasted marshmallows and singing campfire songs. Tim thought it was a very good day.

Joey got a German Shepherd for his birthday present. He had never had any pets before, but was always excited to see the other dogs and cats in his neighborhood. Since his birthday was in June, he spent a lot of time playing outside with his new puppy, which he named Max. Max and Joey would often run through fields in a game of chase. They also liked to go through the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek. They never went near the lake because Joey was afraid of water. One day, Max hid a little too well and Joey couldn't find him. Joey spent the afternoon looking for his German Shepherd where they often played, like the field and forest. Joey was a shy boy who often read by himself, and Max was his best friend.  After dinner, he went to look for Max one last time before he had to take a bath and go to bed. He heard some barking on the next street, so he ran to see if it was his puppy. Sure enough, he saw Max playing with a poodle. The dogs were having so much fun. Joey brought Max home, happy that he had his puppy back. Max seemed to be happy to have his human by his side as well as a new doggy friend. All summer long, Joey took Max to the poodle's house so they could play without having to worry about losing his present.

One day, Max hid a little too well and Joey couldn't find him. Joey spent the afternoon looking for his German Shepherd where they often played, like the field and forest. Joey was a shy boy who often read by himself, and Max was his best friend.  After dinner, he went to look for Max one last time before he had to take a bath and go to bed. He heard some barking on the next street, so he ran to see if it was his puppy. Sure enough, he saw Max playing with a poodle. The dogs were having so much fun. Joey brought Max home, happy that he had his puppy back. Max seemed to be happy to have his human by his side as well as a new doggy friend. All summer long, Joey took Max to the poodle's house so they could play without having to worry about losing his present.

When it was time to open the presents he opened them one at a time. The first present was not a bike. The second present was not a bike. The third present was the biggest one. Tim knew if the bike was going to be in any of the presents it was going to be in this box. Tim opened it and there was no bike inside.

On Saturday, Amy and Joe baked a whole chicken for their family's dinner.  They rinsed it in cold water, rubbed it with spices, and put it into a pan.  After they had heated up the oven, they put the chicken and the pan on the center oven rack and set the timer.  Then, as they peeled potatoes and carrots to go with the chicken, Amy, Joe and Cindy talked about dinner.  Amy said, "Joe, this is too much food for you, me and little Cindy to eat in one night. We'll have leftovers.  What can we do with the leftover chicken?"  Joe said, "We could make chicken sandwiches or chicken and rice."  Amy said, "How about chicken soup?"  Cindy said, "I like chicken with Thai noodles with red peppers.  We haven't made those in a long time."   "That sounds good," said Amy.  "We'll make that for dinner tomorrow."  "Yum!" said Joe.  "That's a great idea.  I love Thai noodles."  Later, Joe, Amy and Cindy had finished eating dinner, and Cindy asked Amy for help with her homework.  "I don't understand how to do these math problems!"  Joe said, "You two go ahead.  I'll do the dishes and put away the leftovers."  Soon, Cindy went into the kitchen to get a glass of water.  Joe was eating the chicken. It was almost gone!  "Dad!" said Cindy, "You have eaten almost all of the leftover chicken. We can't have Thai noodles with chicken tomorrow."  Joe looked very sad.  He said "I'm sorry.  I have been a bad dad.  I have to buy more chicken so that we can still have noodles.  Would you like a piece of chicken?"

Then, as they peeled potatoes and carrots to go with the chicken, Amy, Joe and Cindy talked about dinner.  Amy said, "Joe, this is too much food for you, me and little Cindy to eat in one night. We'll have leftovers.  What can we do with the leftover chicken?"  Joe said, "We could make chicken sandwiches or chicken and rice."  Amy said, "How about chicken soup?"  Cindy said, "I like chicken with Thai noodles with red peppers.  We haven't made those in a long time."   "That sounds good," said Amy.  "We'll make that for dinner tomorrow."  "Yum!" said Joe.  "That's a great idea.  I love Thai noodles."  Later, Joe, Amy and Cindy had finished eating dinner, and Cindy asked Amy for help with her homework.  "I don't understand how to do these math problems!"  Joe said, "You two go ahead.  I'll do the dishes and put away the leftovers."  Soon, Cindy went into the kitchen to get a glass of water.  Joe was eating the chicken. It was almost gone!  "Dad!" said Cindy, "You have eaten almost all of the leftover chicken. We can't have Thai noodles with chicken tomorrow."  Joe looked very sad.  He said "I'm sorry.  I have been a bad dad.  I have to buy more chicken so that we can still have noodles.  Would you like a piece of chicken?"

John thought about things that he liked to do.  Well, for one, he liked baseball. Compared to his friends, he was very good at the sport. He didn't even have to practice that much. He remembered that he once hit the ball so hard that it flew out of the park. Home run!  He was also a fan of basketball. He enjoyed watching people on television pull off crazy tricks like slam dunking (but he didn't really like all of the passes). He wasn't quite that good yet, but he was pretty good at making shots from the three point line. He knew that if he kept practicing, he would be really great someday.  Finally, he loved football. Unlike baseball and basketball, he didn't play football himself, but he was drawn to the games. He got a kick out of sitting in the stands, cheering on his team and friends. He once cheered so loud that he could barely speak at all for the rest of the day.
Based on Reading John likes to do, Reading else do you think John would enjoy.

Mary loved walking through the woods with her dog, Max.  Max and Mary would go on all sorts of adventures together.  They really loved looking for blueberries together and then falling asleep next to each other in the tall grass.  One day, as Mary was picking the blueberries, she turned around to find that Max was not there.  She became worried and ran off to look for her dog.    She looked in all of their favorite spots...next to the stream, in their secret hiding place behind the raspberry bushes, and even inside the old cabin that sat in the woods.  But poor Max was nowhere to be found.  Nonetheless, Mary would not give up.   She kept looking and she found him not very far away.  He had seen a squirrel and run to chase it.  When Mary called Max's name he left the squirrel and happily returned to Mary, wagging his tail as he went.

Todd is a small boy in the town of Rocksville. Todd thinks his town is the best place in the world, and out of all the places in Rocksville, Todd loves to play in Lake Keet the most. Lake Keet is a small lake with fish, plants, and even little shells. Todd's favorite part was the big rock in the middle of the lake. Todd lives pretty close to the lake, so he gets to go there a lot, but could never to get to the rock in the middle. Todd's dad never lets him swim too far because Todd can't swim very well. During summer, Todd told his dad that he wanted to get to the rock before break ended. Todd's dad told him he had to try his hardest. If he did, then Todd's dad would watch him swim every day. If Todd wanted to try and get to the rock, his dad would follow him there to make sure he was safe. Todd's dad wrote this down in his notebook so he wouldn't forget. After a week, Todd made his first try to get to the rock, and his dad followed him like he said he would. Todd didn't make it to the rock before he got tired and had to turn around. He practiced even harder for the next two weeks and wanted to try again. So, a month after summer started, Todd tried to reach the rock again. This time, Todd gave it his all and got all the way to the rock. He was very happy, and his dad was very proud of his son's hard work. To celebrate, Todd's dad carved Todd's name and the date into a tree. This way, they would always remember Todd's hard work.
it was before Todd made it to the rock One month.

Mortamer was a tree monkey who lived in the jungles of Brazil with his parents, and their pet snail, Johnson.  They lived in a grass house built in the very tops of the trees, so high that they could see the whole jungle from their front porch. One day, Mortamer and his parents were outside hunting for food and the sky turned black! The sun was gone, hidden behind giant black clouds! Big winds shook the very trees of the forest, scaring poor little Mortamer who had turned 7 years old yesterday.   Then, without warning, the sun was back! It was bright and sunny, and jungle birds were singing with all the other jungle animals.  Little Mortamer and his parents quickly went back to their tree, only to find something very sad!  Their poor little house lay on the ground, smashed to pieces!  The wind knocked it down!  Little Mortamer was very sad, and started to cry.  His parents smiled, and started to pick up the pieces.  Other monkeys came by to help, too.  Soon everyone was fixing Mortamer's house, and he was a very happy monkey.

Hannah Harvey was a ten year old that had many friends in school.  She lived in New York and enjoyed doing gymnastics and playing soccer.  One day, Hannah came home from school and her parents greeted her.  She knew that something was different by the expressions on their faces.  Even Jackson, Hannah's dog, was acting different.  Hannah asked why everyone was being so strange. Hannah's father, who was known as Pop, explained to Hannah that his job was forcing him to move.  Hannah did not seem to think this was too big of a deal.  Then, Hannah's mother explained that they were moving to Kenya.  Kenya, she explained, was a place in Africa and life would be very different there.  As Hannah began to cry thinking about all of her friends at home, Hannah's mother calmed her with a gentle touch.  Jackson began howling as Hannah cried, but was also calmed by Hannah's mother. Hannah spent the next two weeks visiting her friends and saying her goodbyes.  She did not know the next time she would be home.  She cried very hard when she said goodbye to her best friend, Susan. Susan did not quite understand where Kenya was, but promised to visit Hannah. The next day, Hannah boarded a plane with her family. At first, they thought that Jackson could not come with them.  However, Hannah worked hard and helped make sure that he had all of his shots so that he could come. After he had them all, the airport said it was OK for Jackson to come!  The Harvey family left and off they went across the ocean to begin their new life in Kenya.

One day, Lucy was taking her dog to the park when she saw a big ice cream truck.   It did not look like other ice cream trucks she had seen before, so she rushed to look at it.   Inside, she saw that this truck had many different flavors of ice cream that the other trucks didn't have.  This truck had chocolate, strawberry, banana and even mint flavors!  She wanted to get some ice cream, but when she got to the truck she saw that she had no money.  She remembered then that she left it at home. All the other children were going up to the truck, but Lucy couldn't because she had no money.  She rushed home with her dog at her side, and jumped across fences and ran across sidewalks as quickly as she could, trying her hardest to get home.   When she got home, she got her money and ran back the way she came to the ice cream truck, but it was gone.  Lucy was very sad. She went back home and...  ...found that her Mom had bought ice cream for everyone!

The family across the street has a cat. He is a cute black kitty named Dillon. The cat is about two years old, and the family has had him for about a year. He is an indoor cat who is not allowed to go outside. The children like to play with Dillon because he still acts like a kitten. Dillon jumps around, and chases flies, beetles and spiders. When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn't try to hurt them with his claws. Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread. The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes. But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can. Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away. He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers. The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns. The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread. They yell at him when he walks on the table. But Dillon does not listen. The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat. The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook, and that's why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much!
the family deals with Dillon's odd food liking feed him cat food.

The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns. The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread. They yell at him when he walks on the table. But Dillon does not listen. The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat. The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook, and that's why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much!
gray color cat is Dillon.
The family across the street has a cat. He is a cute black kitty named Dillon. The cat is about two years old, and the family has had him for about a year. He is an indoor cat who is not allowed to go outside. The children like to play with Dillon because he still acts like a kitten. Dillon jumps around, and chases flies, beetles and spiders. When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn't try to hurt them with his claws. Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread.

It is almost summer time. Spring has been very long and very rainy. Winter was very warm and very long. In the winter the snows falls on the ground. It covers all the grass. It covers all the trees.  It covers all the flowers.    In the winter, the chipmunk goes to sleep. The chipmunk works all summer long to gather enough food for the winter. The chipmunk gathers berries. The chipmunk gathers pine cones. The chipmunk drops the pine cones off our roof and rolls them to her favorite hiding place. Boom!  Boom!  Boom! The pine cones sound so loud when they drop off the roof!  The snow melts away in the spring. It is off the ground in our yard by the month of May. In June, there is still snow on the mountains. The snow on the mountains is still there until July.  In May the grass starts to grow. In June, the flowers bloom again. In July, we go swimming in the lake.    We get to play all summer. We do not have to go to school. We do not have to gather pine cones for food. We get to play outside and we get to have cook outs. We are not chipmunks. We are children.  Our mom makes us lemonade in the summer time. Our mom takes us to the beach. Our mom lets us have a lot of campfires. Our mom mows the lawn.  It is summer time and now we play for 90 days and the chipmunk works for 90 days.  In the winter we work and go to school and the chipmunk gets to sleep.  I am glad it is summer and I am glad that I am a human child and not a chipmunk. I am glad that we get to be awake through all the seasons.  I like spring. I like fall. I like winter. My favorite time of all is, for sure, summer!

The snow on the mountains is still there until July.  In May the grass starts to grow. In June, the flowers bloom again. In July, we go swimming in the lake.    We get to play all summer. We do not have to go to school. We do not have to gather pine cones for food. We get to play outside and we get to have cook outs. We are not chipmunks. We are children.  Our mom makes us lemonade in the summer time. Our mom takes us to the beach. Our mom lets us have a lot of campfires. Our mom mows the lawn.  It is summer time and now we play for 90 days and the chipmunk works for 90 days.  In the winter we work and go to school and the chipmunk gets to sleep.  I am glad it is summer and I am glad that I am a human child and not a chipmunk. I am glad that we get to be awake through all the seasons.  I like spring. I like fall. I like winter. My favorite time of all is, for sure, summer!

Abby and Emma are outside one day to do something special for someone. They are picking flowers for their mother's birthday.   Right before they are finished picking their flowers to surprise their mother, the girls see that the clouds in the sky have turned grey and that the sun is no longer shining. It looks like it's going to rain soon.  Abby looks down at her small hand of purple flowers and frowns.  "What's wrong, Abby?" Emma asks, turning to look at her sister studying her flowers.   "Well," Abby says, "We got the flowers, but it looks like rain."  Emma looks up at the cloudy sky and nods.  "If it rains, we can't make mommy a mud pie," Abby adds with sadness.   Emma looks down at her own white flowers, counting them, and thinks. After making sure she had four flowers, she looks at Abby with an idea.   "What if we get the mud and take it in the house? That way if it rains, we can still make a cake," Emma says.   "Good idea!" Abby smiles, happy again.   Flowers in hand, the girls grab a yellow pail, placing their flowers on the porch, as they walk towards the mud to get what they need for their mother's birthday cake.
Abby and Emma doing outside at the beginning are picking flowers.

It looks like it's going to rain soon.  Abby looks down at her small hand of purple flowers and frowns.  "What's wrong, Abby?" Emma asks, turning to look at her sister studying her flowers.   "Well," Abby says, "We got the flowers, but it looks like rain."  Emma looks up at the cloudy sky and nods.  "If it rains, we can't make mommy a mud pie," Abby adds with sadness.   Emma looks down at her own white flowers, counting them, and thinks. After making sure she had four flowers, she looks at Abby with an idea.   "What if we get the mud and take it in the house? That way if it rains, we can still make a cake," Emma says.   "Good idea!" Abby smiles, happy again.   Flowers in hand, the girls grab a yellow pail, placing their flowers on the porch, as they walk towards the mud to get what they need for their mother's birthday cake.
Emma has 5 flowers.

I am very hungry. I look for my mother.  When is dinner? I ask.  Dinner is at six, my mother says.  What can we eat? I ask.  We can pick food from our garden, she says. I help her pick corn, beans, and peas.  The corn is yellow and white. The beans are small and brown. The peas are green and round.  I put the beans in a basket. I put the peas in a bowl. Mother brings the corn. We go inside.  I have dirty hands. I wash my hands with soap and water. The water is warm. My hands are now clean.  Mother lets me stir the beans. I fill a pot with water. Mother puts the corn into the pot. She puts the pot on the stove. The water boils.  Mary is my sister. Mary puts four plates on the table. Each plate is blue.  We each eat two pieces of meat. I eat more corn than Mary. Mary eats more beans than our mother.  What did you learn today? Mary asks.  I can spell ten new words, I say.  Mary can only spell two words.

Years back in a kingdom far away there lived a family in the woods.  This family had always lived in the woods.  Their father each day would travel into the woods and chop wood to take to the town.  The mother spent her day cleaning and taking care of their home and her three children.  The dad and his family had a good life.  They never wanted for much. The three kids went to school and had many friends in the town. One day there came a nasty storm to the woods.  This storm brought a lot of rain and flooded many areas in the city.  Many homes were under water.  The leader came to the dad and asked him to go out and cut some very large logs to place in the city to keep the water back.  The logs would be used to build a wall. The dad took his kids and his wife into the woods and cut down the largest trees they could find.  In the end the town was saved because of the wall and for their work the dad and his family were paid and could build a bigger home and had more children.

One day a boy was looking for a school lunch in the fridge. He was looking for something that was good for him, but also something that tasted good. He was going to school, and needed something to keep him going and doing well in class. Recently he had been eating cookies for lunch, and was tired by the end of the day. The cookies came from the school lunchroom, and his mom didn't know about them. Finally he got tired of cookies and thought he needed something good for him. So, he asked his mom to come help him out. First he got a doughnut. "That's not good for you at all!" said his mom. So, his mom got a big bag of broccoli. "Yuk, I hate the taste of broccoli," said the boy. They looked and looked and couldn't find anything that looked good to the boy that was also good for him. Finally, they saw the perfect thing: some grilled chicken from the party on the weekend. It was so delicious the first time, and it tasted great cold for lunch. The chicken had the types of food he needed to get through the day.

Jim and Linda are our neighbors.  Jim and Linda have an old dog named Reggie.  We love our neighbors.  They are like the perfect grandparents.   We watch Reggie for them when they go out of town to see their children and grandchildren.  Reggie is so fun to have around.  He is 14 years old.  We have 3 other dogs and Reggie is older than all of them.  They all listen to what Reggie tells them to do.  It is fun to see them respect him.  We are watching Reggie now.  He is staying with us for 3 weeks.  He likes to go for rides in the car.  He likes to go for walks.  This time, when Jim and Linda dropped Reggie off, Jim picked up mom's guitar and played us a song.  He was really good!  Then Jim and Linda sang a song for us.  I can see why Reggie misses them when they are gone.  They are so nice!  We give Reggie lots of love so that he is happy at our house when they are on vacation.  He likes our dogs and cats.  We have a big black dog named Able.  We have a little dog named Mudpuppy and we have a puppy named Goldberry.  We have two cats.  One of our cats is named Glitch.  She has lots of colors.  We also have a white kitten named Vex.  One of the best things about watching Reggie is that we know when Jim and Linda come home, Linda bakes us a cherry pie for taking care of Reggie.  She makes delicious pie. We are very lucky to have such nice neighbors!

It was very warm for February. Anna and her brother, John, played outside in the beautiful, sunny weather. Dad was washing his car. When Mom came home with the groceries, Dad sent the kids to help carry bags. They ran to the garage to help her. But when they got there, Mom was kneeling on the ground near where their bikes were parked, petting a gray cat with long hair.  "Can we pet her?" Anna asked.  "Be careful," Mom said. Anna knew these directions were for her brother, who was often rough with things.  "She's fat," John giggled.  "She's not fat. She's pregnant," Mom told him.  "What's that mean?" John asked.  "It means she's going to have kittens." Anna said. "Can we keep her?" Anna begged. "Please?"  Mom and Dad looked at each other.  "We could take her to the pound, or she could stay outside here," Mom said. "Long-haired cats give you rashes."  "But you always said you wanted one," Dad told Mom. "Short-haired cats don't bother me, and if she stays here, we have to give the kittens away. Let's send her over to your parents' farm. She can live in the barn, and then if one of the kittens has short hair, we can keep that one."  The kids were excited. They named the cat Socks because she had white feet, and they went to visit her every day. Socks had her kittens in April, and, to everyone's excitement, two of them had short hair. Dad said that since they were brother and sister, they could keep both kittens. Anna named her kitten Lucky, and John named his kitten Spike. The other two kittens, Butterscotch and Squeakers, stayed at Grandma and Grandpa's house, but Anna and John each got a kitten of their very own.

Anna knew these directions were for her brother, who was often rough with things.  "She's fat," John giggled.  "She's not fat. She's pregnant," Mom told him.  "What's that mean?" John asked.  "It means she's going to have kittens." Anna said. "Can we keep her?" Anna begged. "Please?"  Mom and Dad looked at each other.  "We could take her to the pound, or she could stay outside here," Mom said. "Long-haired cats give you rashes."  "But you always said you wanted one," Dad told Mom. "Short-haired cats don't bother me, and if she stays here, we have to give the kittens away. Let's send her over to your parents' farm. She can live in the barn, and then if one of the kittens has short hair, we can keep that one."  The kids were excited. They named the cat Socks because she had white feet, and they went to visit her every day. Socks had her kittens in April, and, to everyone's excitement, two of them had short hair. Dad said that since they were brother and sister, they could keep both kittens. Anna named her kitten Lucky, and John named his kitten Spike. The other two kittens, Butterscotch and Squeakers, stayed at Grandma and Grandpa's house, but Anna and John each got a kitten of their very own.

Then they went to the food store and picked out all of Josh's favorite foods. They got chicken, hamburgers, hot dogs so they could cook everything on the grill. When it came time for the party, Josh's best friend Ryan was the first to get there. Soon, all of Josh's friends were there and everybody had a great time.

They went to the sports store and got a basketball hoop that they could put in the pool, so people could play water basketball. Then they went to the food store and picked out all of Josh's favorite foods. They got chicken, hamburgers, hot dogs so they could cook everything on the grill. When it came time for the party, Josh's best friend Ryan was the first to get there. Soon, all of Josh's friends were there and everybody had a great time. The weather was perfect and the food was delicious. It was the best seventh birthday ever!
Amanda was the first person to get to the party.

Jenny and Katie were very happy.  Their mom was taking them to the circus.  She had told them about it on Tuesday.  They were going on Saturday afternoon.  Their dad said they had to do their chores Saturday morning first or they would not get to go.  They were going to get up early and get them done.  They had been looking forward to this for the last few days.  They had told their grandma and grandpa all about it when they saw them on Wednesday.  It was hard to sleep, they were so excited and could not wait to go.  They could not wait to get an elephant ride.  They did this last year and thought it was so fun. Jenny wanted to see the monkeys, too; they were her favorite.  Katie couldn't wait to see the lions; she thought they were the best.

Once upon a time there was a bird named Lily. She lived in a tree with her parents. One day Lily flew to her friend Molly's tree nest, but she didn't ask for her parents' permission. They were having lots of fun playing that the time passed by so fast. They played tag. They played hide and seek. They even played racing to see who could fly the fastest. Lily's parents started to get very worried when she didn't return home for dinner. They called neighbors and friends, and even called Molly but they didn't hear the phone ringing. It wasn't until Molly's mom called her down to eat that Lily saw that it was almost past dinner time. Lily told Molly she had to go home. When Lily got home her parents were crying and very upset because they thought something happened to her. Lily felt very bad for not telling her parents, and she said she would never leave without telling them again. Her parents forgave her and sent her to bed. Lily went right to sleep.

John was in the third grade, and nine years old. Every day he had to walk home from school. There were some kids in his class who were mean to him, and during the winter they would throw snowballs at him. John could have told the teacher, but one of the kids was a very pretty girl. She was mean, but John liked her because she was pretty and did not want her to get in trouble.   One day, his teacher asked John to stay after class to wipe off the chalkboard and to empty the pencil sharpener. By the time he was done, the other kids had gone home. They could no longer throw snowballs at him. John did not mind helping out his teacher, and he soon stayed after class every day.   John was not very good at math, and sometimes his teacher would help him when he stayed after school. She said if John could help her out for at least two weeks, he could pass his math class. John thought it was a good deal, and ended up being much better at math.

Yesterday, Emily and Evelyn went to the zoo with their mom. They left the house right after breakfast so that they would be there when the zoo opened. Once inside, they raced to see the monkeys swinging around their cages. There were even two baby monkeys!  The girls also enjoyed feeding birds in the walk-in bird cage. The birds were very interested in picking seeds from the popsicle stick that Emily held out to them. Next, it was time to stop for ice cream. Each girl chose a small cup of soft ice cream. Emily chose a swirl of chocolate and vanilla and Evelyn had chocolate. Ice cream at the zoo was the perfect treat on a hot summer day.  The best part of the girls' visit was the giraffe area. They walked past rhinos and tortoises to get to the giraffe area which was on a raised deck. The giraffes stretched their necks up to the deck to eat leaves and hay that were placed there for them. Emily and Evelyn bought special crackers to feed to the giraffes. Emily liked that she could pet the giraffes when they reached out to grab the crackers with their long tongues. Evelyn liked to watch the giraffes, but did not want to feed one herself. After feeding the giraffes, the girls left the zoo, hot and tired and ready to return soon!
birds type of animal did Emily and Evelyn visit first at the zoo.

Emily chose a swirl of chocolate and vanilla and Evelyn had chocolate. Ice cream at the zoo was the perfect treat on a hot summer day.  The best part of the girls' visit was the giraffe area. They walked past rhinos and tortoises to get to the giraffe area which was on a raised deck. The giraffes stretched their necks up to the deck to eat leaves and hay that were placed there for them. Emily and Evelyn bought special crackers to feed to the giraffes. Emily liked that she could pet the giraffes when they reached out to grab the crackers with their long tongues. Evelyn liked to watch the giraffes, but did not want to feed one herself. After feeding the giraffes, the girls left the zoo, hot and tired and ready to return soon!
a cup of vanilla ice cream type of ice cream did Evelyn eat.

Joe asked his mom if she could give him money. There was a new action toy that he saw on the TV that he really wanted to have. The action toy was of the superhero he loved the most. It was painted red with a blue bow and arrow. He wanted to go to the mall right away to get the toy because there was only one left in the store. His mom told him that she would take him to the mall later in the day. She told him he would have to eat his dinner first. Joe was very happy that he would get his new toy. After he ate dinner, Joe's mom took him to the mall. On the way to the mall, there was a cat that was stuck in a tree. The fire truck blocked the street to save the cat. Joe became sad because he thought that he was never going to get his toy. The fireman saved the cat and moved the truck out of the way. Joe's mom kept driving to the mall. Joe got his toy and he was happy.

Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house, there lived a little white kitten named Cotton. Cotton lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer's horses slept.  But Cotton wasn't alone in her little home above the barn, oh no. She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton's mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing.   "What are you doing, Cotton?!"   "I only wanted to be more like you".   Cotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said "Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way". And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry.   "Don't ever do that again, Cotton!" they all cried. "Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!"  Then Cotton thought, "I change my mind. I like being special".

She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing.   "What are you doing, Cotton?!"   "I only wanted to be more like you".   Cotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said "Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way". And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry.   "Don't ever do that again, Cotton!" they all cried. "Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!"  Then Cotton thought, "I change my mind. I like being special".
Cottondo to herself that did made her mommy and sisters laugh She painted green stripes on herself.

The king, Banton, stood over his men who were tired from fighting. The dragons were not as tired as the men. He could not let any more pain happen to his men. He ordered the men to run away. The men went to the village. "Everyone must run for the hills."   Charlie, the purple dragon let out a roar, and sent fire into the sky from his mouth. "That's right! Run little man! Run!" Luna and Milkyway, the grey and black dragons, cheered and celebrated the win. The dragons went to the river and started eating berries, and fruits. "Now we celebrate! We have what we want! Now we won't be hungry anymore!" Charlie cheered. "Good things are sure to come from this win over the humans!"  Luna, not so sure, watched the humans running for their lives.  The villagers could only watch the dragons take food from their land, afraid. They went to pack their things. They would need to leave with the king, and his men. There would be no soldiers to protect them from the dragons. Men, women, and children all ran around in confusion trying to get away. Before long, the village was vacated. It was okay; the villagers found a new home in the hills.

Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named Scoop. He was a very friendly giraffe and he was cute, too. He had beautiful orange and yellow markings and he loved to play with his friends, but Scoop had a problem. His neck was really short, so he could not reach the tall plants and his mommy and daddy had to get all of his food for him.  One day, Scoop's friend Scap, invited him over for a sleepover party. It sounded like so much fun, but Scoop was too embarrassed. He didn't want everyone to laugh at him at feeding time when he couldn't reach the food by himself, so he said he could not come to the party  Scap was a really good friend and he knew that Scoop wanted to come to the party, so he came up with a plan.  That afternoon, Scap gathered all the little giraffes in the neighborhood and they spent the day together collecting food. They then went to Scoop's house and showed him all the food they had gathered for the party and once again invited him along. He happily said yes and they all had a wonderful time.

On a sunny day in July, Sylvia left the front gate open. From the spot where Rex was napping in the grassy yard, he had listened to the sound of the gate sliding open, and waited for it to snap shut. It didn't. The click of Sylvia's shoes faded into the distance, and yet the snap of the shutting gate didn't come. Finally, Rex pushed himself up on one paw so he could look towards the front of the yard, where the gate moved in the breeze. Rex moved slowly towards the gate at first, but as he neared the sidewalk he shot through the opening, his shiny black fur twinkling in the sun as he sped down the street. Rex ran from block to block through the neighborhood, with no leash to pull him back. When all four legs started to burn from running, Rex slowed down and started sniffing the grass around him. His stomach growled and he hoped he'd find some food in the grass. All he found was sidewalk chalk, a few little black ants, and flowers that made him sneeze. The sun was going down, and Rex thought about Sylvia coming home to rub his ears and fill his food bowl. He looked up and down the sidewalk for his home. Nothing. Rex was lost. He stood completely still and raised his ears as high as they would go. He sat and listened, and listened and sat. Just as the sun passed over the mountains in the distance, Rex heard, from very far away, the soft "click click click" of Sylvia walking towards the house. Rex ran home.
Rex looking is forward to about going home Sylvia rubbing his ears and feeding him.

It didn't. The click of Sylvia's shoes faded into the distance, and yet the snap of the shutting gate didn't come. Finally, Rex pushed himself up on one paw so he could look towards the front of the yard, where the gate moved in the breeze. Rex moved slowly towards the gate at first, but as he neared the sidewalk he shot through the opening, his shiny black fur twinkling in the sun as he sped down the street. Rex ran from block to block through the neighborhood, with no leash to pull him back. When all four legs started to burn from running, Rex slowed down and started sniffing the grass around him. His stomach growled and he hoped he'd find some food in the grass. All he found was sidewalk chalk, a few little black ants, and flowers that made him sneeze. The sun was going down, and Rex thought about Sylvia coming home to rub his ears and fill his food bowl. He looked up and down the sidewalk for his home. Nothing. Rex was lost. He stood completely still and raised his ears as high as they would go. He sat and listened, and listened and sat. Just as the sun passed over the mountains in the distance, Rex heard, from very far away, the soft "click click click" of Sylvia walking towards the house. Rex ran home.

When Sophie woke up that morning, she had no idea where her day was going to take her. She rolled out of bed, turned off her alarm and stretched. She wasn't feeling like herself that morning, but she wasn't sure why. Sophie thought to herself, "I slept well, I ate good food yesterday, and yet I still felt strange". Sophie stepped into the shower feeling so tired. As she toweled herself off and got dressed, she felt like she was moving very slowly. She went to the kitchen and poured herself a glass of orange juice, got a bowl out of the cabinet and filled it with cereal. As Sophie sat at the table to eat her breakfast, she remembered why she wasn't feeling like herself. She remembered that she didn't exercise the day before. She had spent much of the day sitting in front of her television and playing games. Sophie knew that on days that she didn't exercise, she always felt bad the next day. Sophie thought for a second, and then looked at the clock. She had time to do some jumping jacks and run outside around her house before she had to leave for the day. She put on her running shoes and went out the front door. After only a quick bit of exercise, Sophie was feeling much better. She promised herself that she would never forget to exercise again.

His grandpa did not catch any fish that day.  David did better than him and he was happy.  Someday he wants to go fishing in the ocean.  He hopes someone takes him there.  He dreams about it all the time.  He knows he would catch many huge fish in the ocean.  He can't wait until he is older.  This way he can go fishing anytime he wants to.  He wants to buy his own fishing boat. He wants a big yellow boat.  Tonight, David can't sleep. He is so excited.  His dad told him he can take him fishing tomorrow.  He thinks about all the fish he is going to catch.

When I was a little boy, I could remember my mom making breakfast and dinner for us. And I remember one night, when she had made dinner after a long, hard day at work. On that evening, my mom placed a plate of vegetables, salad and burned chicken breast in front of my dad. I remember waiting to see if anyone saw, yet all my dad did was to reach for his chicken breast, smile at mom and ask me how my day was at school. I don't remember what I told him that night, but I do remember watching him drop hot sauce on that chicken breast and eat every bite.  When I got up from the table that evening, I remember hearing my mom apologize to my dad for burning the chicken breast. I'll never forget what he said. "Dear, I love burnt chicken breast."  Later that night, I went to kiss daddy good night and I asked him if he really liked his chicken breast burnt. He put his arms around me and said "Dear, your momma put in a hard day at work today and she's real tired and a little burnt chicken breast never hurt anyone."

Tony was riding his bike home from school.  Then he saw Cindy riding her bike in front of him.    Tony yelled, "Hey, Cindy!"  Then he rode faster to catch up with her.   Cindy said, "Tony! Hey!  Where are you going?"  "I'm going to the empty lot on Maple Street to ride my bike.  The other kids are going to be there.  Do you want to come?"  "Sure," said Cindy.  Tony and Cindy rode to Maple Street, to the empty lot.  The empty lot did not have a house on it.  Instead, it had big hills of dirt, and it had trees cut down on the ground.  There was a low part that became a pond after it rained.  The lot had been empty for a couple of years, because times were bad and the builder couldn't find a buyer for another house.  The kids had ridden their bikes over the hills of dirt, around the cut trees, and through the muddy pond. There were bike trails all over the empty lot.  There were even places where the kids could jump their bikes.    There were three other children riding their bikes at the empty lot when Tony and Cindy arrived: Lana, Billy and Chris.   Cindy said, "I am calling my mom to let her know that I'm here."    Tony said, "That's a good idea.  Can I use your phone when you're done?"  Cindy said "Sure!  Keep it for now.  I'm going to go on the jump path.  I was scared to try it last time.  I don't want to break my phone if I fall.  I'm leaving my backpack here, too."  "Okay." said Tony.  "I'll watch.  You'll do good."
Cindy left her phone with Tony because It was too heavy.

Jamal made his mommy a special card for her birthday.  When he gave it to her, she smiled and said that it was beautiful.  His dad also gave her a card, but she did not smile the same way.  Mommy didn't look mad, but Jamal knew that she was disappointed.    The next day, Jamal's dad drove him to school.  Jamal said "Daddy, did Mommy not like your birthday card?"    Jamal's dad said, "Well, son, sometimes I don't know what your mother likes.  I could have asked her or thought of something better."    Before Jamal got out of the car, he asked his dad, "Can we go to get ice cream after you pick me up from school?"    "Sure, that sounds good to me," said Jamal's dad.  After school, Jamal and his dad went to the ice cream shop. Jamal said, "Now we can get Mommy the present!"    Jamal's dad said, "What present?  Did you have a secret plan?"    Jamal giggled and ran to the plant store nearby.  Jamal remembered that when Mommy took him to his grandma's house, she told Grandma that she always wanted to have a lily plant.  They found a lily plant in the store.  The woman who worked at the store asked, "Do you want to put this in a pot?"    Jamal's dad told Jamal, "Let's get the yellow pot, because that's Mommy's favorite color."    When they got home, Jamal's mommy came out of the kitchen.

A bunny named Mandy lived in a small forest outside of the city. Mandy lived with her mother, father, three sisters and two brothers under a huge old tree.

She had some friends that were birds. They were robins. She did not like the unfriendly black birds. They were loud and would take her food if they could. She loved to play tag with her brothers and sisters and their friend Rocky. He was a squirrel. The creek had a waterfall, it was fun to play around. They would go to the creek for fresh water and sometimes to take a bath. When the frogs made noise the bunnies would laugh. They thought it was such a funny sound.

My parents, Kelly and Kelley, said that it was that time of year to take a family vacation.  We've been to big ride parks that have hotels with large pools.  This year my parents wanted to do something different.  They wanted to take us all to Elk River Castle.  After lots of planning we hit the road for our trip.  My Brother Kelsey and I enjoyed the long car ride there.    Once we arrive, the castle looked much bigger than we had imagined.  There was so much to see and so much to do.  There was a swimming pool, movie theater and an elevator to take us from floor to floor.  What a magical place!  I was so excited because we had the whole place to our family!    We spent our vacation playing around the huge castle and finding small mysterious places. There was even a tiny room in the back of one of the closets.  My brother, Kelsey, and I played hide and go seek for hours, watched movies and swam until the sun went down.  It was sad when our vacation finally came to an end but we made some amazing memories. We'll never forget our trip to Elk River Castle!

Roger was a grasshopper. He loved to hop. He hopped everywhere by himself. One day when he was hopping around he bumped into a frog sitting on a log. The frog told him his name was Gilbert. Gilbert told Roger that it had been a long time since he bumped into anybody. Roger told him that since both grasshoppers and frogs like to jump they would make great friends. The next day they were hopping through a field and they saw something very strange.  In a pond they saw a spider floating on a lily pad. The spider was very sad because he did not have any friends. Roger and Gilbert asked him why he didn't have any friends. The spider told them that everybody would scream and run away when they saw him. Roger and Gilbert told him that he didn't look scary to them and that he could come along with them if he wanted. So Sam the spider said yes, and the three of them began a life time friendship full of adventures.

The cute red ball rolled over to the blue ball and said hello. The blue ball was scared and went to cry to the green ball. The green ball laughed at the blue ball. Then the green ball told the orange ball that blue ball was stupid. Most felt this was not good to do and so they punished the green ball by taking away all his air.  From that day on everyone saw the air-less green ball and knew that they could not do or say any bad things. This is how the trouble started. The purple ball used the fear of everyone to become the leader that they all feared. The purple ball was mean to everyone. Until one day the red ball spoke up and got all the other colored balls together and they took the air from the purple ball and put it in the green ball. Sadly, the green ball had been without air for too long and was dead.

Peter was a very sad puppy.  He had been inside of the pet store for a very long time.  In fact, he had been there for three months!  Peter had seen many other puppies find a person; he began to wonder why he could not get one.  He thought that maybe his fur was not pretty enough or maybe his bark was not loud enough.  He tried and tried to please every person who came to the store, but they all picked smaller puppies.  However, one day all of this changed.  Sammie came into the store looking for a golden puppy.  She wanted a puppy she could snuggle with.  It so happened that Peter was very sad and tired that day. Sammie came to hold him.  Peter wanted to show off his bark, but he was too tired.  He fell right to sleep.  Sammie loved him at once and loved holding him in her arms.  Sammie took Peter home that day, and they made lots of fun memories.

He tried and tried to please every person who came to the store, but they all picked smaller puppies.  However, one day all of this changed.  Sammie came into the store looking for a golden puppy.  She wanted a puppy she could snuggle with.  It so happened that Peter was very sad and tired that day. Sammie came to hold him.  Peter wanted to show off his bark, but he was too tired.  He fell right to sleep.  Sammie loved him at once and loved holding him in her arms.  Sammie took Peter home that day, and they made lots of fun memories.

Luna the hawk wanted some socks. It was the middle of winter and sitting on tree branches made her feet very cold. Luna hoped that her friends could help her find some socks. She flew to the old maple tree where Olive the owl lived.  "Olive, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?" she asked.  Olive the owl looked surprised. "Luna, I have no use for socks because my legs and toes have thick feathers. Go visit one of the animals that walk on four legs. They might have extra socks you could borrow."  Luna flew across the field and landed next to the icy creek. Rose the raccoon was teaching her six babies how to wash their paws. The water was very cold, but the babies were having fun.  "Rose, my bare legs and bare toes are so cold, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?" begged Luna.  Rose laughed hard. "Silly Luna, I do not have socks. Look at my legs and feet. They are covered with thick, warm fur. I'm sorry I cannot help you. Go visit the humans. Sometimes I tip over their garbage cans at night when I am looking for food. Once I saw a pair of socks."  Luna was very afraid of humans. Her grandmother and mother had warned her about them. She was told that some humans are mean and hurt hawks. Her feet were so cold that it was difficult to grip tree branches. She became brave. She flew to the farmhouse on the big hill. When she landed on the roof, she could not believe her eyes. She saw socks! In late autumn, Henrietta the human had put laundry outside to dry and she had forgotten to bring in one tiny pair of socks. The socks were hanging on the clothesline by two wooden pins. Luna used her powerful beak to break the pins. She put on the socks and then flew back to her home in the huge tree. When she landed, her feet were warm and dry. Luna was very happy.

Once upon a time a young boy and young girl set out on a trip to the beach. They packed a few towels, an umbrella, a few beach chairs and a lunch cooler. They drove to the crowded beach parking lot and spent almost an hour trying to find a parking spot. Once they found a spot they parked and began walking to the beach area. They found a nice spot with a good view of the water and set up their belongings. Once they sat down they began to enjoy a nice lunch on the beach. They watched the boats go by and people playing in the water. It was a wonderful day and one they would always remember. Once they arrived home they suddenly found out that they both had a pretty good sunburn. They both said that next time they would use sun screen.

Hannah and her friend Mary were bored.  They sat around the house and tried to think about what to do.  They petted the cat.  They drew pictures in Hannah's notebook.  They snuck into Hannah's mother's closet to try on her shoes, but Hannah's mother caught them.  She said, "You girls need something to do.  Let's take a walk to the park!" Hannah and Mary looked at each other, and then jumped up and down happily.  "The park sounds great!" said Hannah.  "Let's go!" cried Mary.  So Hannah's mother packed up a snack of apples and cookies, and they all set off to walk to the park.  They walked down the sidewalk, looking at all the interesting things along the way.  Mary spotted a squirrel.  Hannah saw a yellow bird.  Hannah's mother pointed out the pretty yellow flowers growing in front of Mr. Smith's house.  When they got to the park, Hannah's mother spread out a picnic blanket and the snack.  Hannah and Mary ran around chasing butterflies for a little time, and then sat down to eat their snacks.  When they finished, Hannah's mother put the leftovers in a trash can.  As they walked back home, Hannah thought that the boring day had turned out quite well.

Douglas loves to play soccer. He plays for the Dolphins. He is very good.  He was excited about the big game with the Lions.  The night before the game, he went to bed late.  He was watching three TV shows that night.  First, was Muffins the Cat.  The second show was Ernie the Talking Donkey.  The third was Laughing with Herman Hamster.  His Mom told him to go to bed, but Douglas didn't listen.  He fell asleep on the couch. He dreamed all night.  First about sheep jumping fences.  Second about playing fetch the ball with Ruffles. Third about Ernie the talking Donkey kicking a soccer ball over the moon. Fourth about his favorite soccer player, Pele, head the ball in the goal.  Finally, the next morning, Douglas got up late because he was so tired.  His Mom called him and the alarm went off, but he did not hear. To get Douglas up, his Mom got Ruffles the dog to lick him in the face.  Douglas got up but had to eat breakfast fast.  Then he quickly dressed into his uniform.  He was yawning.  His Mom drove him to the soccer field.  The game had started.  Douglas had to sit out the first quarter.  His team was losing one to nothing when Howard scored for the Lions. Douglas started the second quarter.  He was tired and could not keep up with the rest of his team.  The coach was surprised that Douglas was so slow.  Usually he was fast.  After the second quarter, the Dolphins were losing two to one after Howard scored again for the Lions and Toby scored a goal for the Dolphins. While the coach gave energy drinks to the team, Douglas fell asleep.  The third quarter started.  Douglas was snoring when the coach told him to go in.  When he saw Douglas was sleeping, he sent Billy into the game.  Billy scored one goal and the Dolphins had tied the game two to two.

On a hot summer day, Brian was walking home from the park. While walking, Brian passed his favorite toy store, and saw that they had a new baseball glove in the window.  Brian's baseball glove was very old and was ripped in a few places.  Brian really wanted the new glove because he wanted to show off his glove to his friends tomorrow. The cost of the new glove was fifteen dollars, but when Brian checked his pockets for money, he only had six dollars and fifty cents.  Brian ran home and went to look around his house for money. He checked under his bed and found fifty cents under some toys.  He then checked all of his pockets of his pants and shorts, and found another two dollars.  Brian then went to look between the cushions on all of the couches in his house, and he found another three dollars.  After finally looking around his whole house, Brian knew that he still did not have enough money to buy the new glove.  Brian went outside and saw his dad doing yard work. He told his dad that he would finish all the yard work for him, if he could have the money he needed for the new glove.  His dad said yes, so Brian spent the rest of the afternoon raking the yard, and bagging leaves.  Brian's dad was very proud that his son was working hard for money. When Brian was finally done, Brian knew that he was too late, and the toy store was closed.  Just as Brian was walking inside, he saw his dad walk up to home holding the new glove that he wanted.  Brian was so happy, and he and his dad spent the rest of the afternoon having a catch.

On a hot summer day, Brian was walking home from the park. While walking, Brian passed his favorite toy store, and saw that they had a new baseball glove in the window.  Brian's baseball glove was very old and was ripped in a few places.  Brian really wanted the new glove because he wanted to show off his glove to his friends tomorrow. The cost of the new glove was fifteen dollars, but when Brian checked his pockets for money, he only had six dollars and fifty cents.  Brian ran home and went to look around his house for money. He checked under his bed and found fifty cents under some toys.  He then checked all of his pockets of his pants and shorts, and found another two dollars.  Brian then went to look between the cushions on all of the couches in his house, and he found another three dollars.  After finally looking around his whole house, Brian knew that he still did not have enough money to buy the new glove.  Brian went outside and saw his dad doing yard work. He told his dad that he would finish all the yard work for him, if he could have the money he needed for the new glove.  His dad said yes, so Brian spent the rest of the afternoon raking the yard, and bagging leaves.  Brian's dad was very proud that his son was working hard for money. When Brian was finally done, Brian knew that he was too late, and the toy store was closed.  Just as Brian was walking inside, he saw his dad walk up to home holding the new glove that he wanted.

On a nice and sunny day, Bob and Sally walked to the beach. When they got there, the first thing they wanted to do was to look for buried treasure. To find the treasure they had brought two shovels and two buckets. They both started digging holes in the sand with their shovels. After looking very hard for treasure for an hour, they didn't find anything. This made Bob and Sally very sad. They gave up and went to play in the water. While they were playing in the water, Sally found a bottle with a little paper inside. Sally opened the bottle and found a treasure map. Sally showed the map to Bob and they started to look for the treasure.  After walking every step that the map said, they started digging with their shovels. After digging a really a big hole, they found a box. They were very happy that they found it and wanted to see what was inside. Bob slowly opened the box and there was a very big pearl.  Next, they ran to a special store to ask about the pearl. The worker in the store told Bob and Sally that the pearl could make them rich. Bob and Sally looked at each other and decided not to sell it. They took the pearl home and saved it in a special box, so they could remember their day at the beach.

It was a beautiful sunny and warm day. I was working outside in my garden. I was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake.  On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. I got up from my garden and walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" to other lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. Then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it coming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt very special that I got to see this. It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.
I doing on this day at the beginning of the story was fishing.

The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to "say" to other lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. Then there is the "where are you" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it coming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt very special that I got to see this. It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.
I doing on this day at the beginning of the story was working in the garden.
It was a beautiful sunny and warm day. I was working outside in my garden. I was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake.

One day Magneson took a walk in the park.  He passed some trees and a pond.  In the pond was a duck named George.  George's wife was also in the pond.  Her name was Nancy.  Magneson walked over to the tree.  Nancy flew up into the tree.  She wanted to warn Magneson about the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree.  A few years before, the squirrel had thrown a chestnut at George and Nancy's son.  He was knocked out, and the squirrel took him away.  He was never seen again.  Magneson asked what their son's name was.  They said it was Leonard.  But Magneson was only making small talk.  He didn't believe the story about the killer squirrel.  Even if there was one, there were many rocks by the pond that he could throw at the squirrel.  He could also hide in the tall grass.  George and Nancy were sorry to see that Magneson wouldn't listen.  They flew away, singing a sad song.  A short time later, the squirrel came out of the tree and threw a giant walnut at Magneson.  No one ever saw Magneson again.

George and Nancy were sorry to see that Magneson wouldn't listen.  They flew away, singing a sad song.  A short time later, the squirrel came out of the tree and threw a giant walnut at Magneson.  No one ever saw Magneson again.

Once there was a young boy named Bret who had a cat named Wolfgang.  The boy had really wanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked to blow things down and they snored.  So the boy had to call his cat Wolfie.  He had also thought about naming his cat Sir Purrsalot.  Bret himself planned to become a knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought Sir Purrsalot sounded like a good name for his brother knight.  The difficulty there was that Wolfie didn't purr a lot.  He purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.  Plus Bret's mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the bathroom and they clanked.  So Bret was left with a cat named Wolfgang.  The neighbors gave him strange looks when he stood in the front yard in the evening and yelled "Wolfie!  Here Wolfie!!!", to get Wolfgang to come in for the night.  But Bret didn't care what anyone else thought.  He had a Wolfie and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.
Wolfie purred on when hogging the bathroom.

name of the cat was Buster.
Once there was a young boy named Bret who had a cat named Wolfgang.  The boy had really wanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked to blow things down and they snored.  So the boy had to call his cat Wolfie.  He had also thought about naming his cat Sir Purrsalot.  Bret himself planned to become a knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought Sir Purrsalot sounded like a good name for his brother knight.  The difficulty there was that Wolfie didn't purr a lot.  He purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.  Plus Bret's mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the bathroom and they clanked.  So Bret was left with a cat named Wolfgang.  The neighbors gave him strange looks when he stood in the front yard in the evening and yelled "Wolfie!  Here Wolfie!!!", to get Wolfgang to come in for the night.  But Bret didn't care what anyone else thought.  He had a Wolfie and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.

Once upon a time, there was a dog named Puddles. Puddles was lonely because he lived in an area where there were no other dogs, but only cats. Day after day, Puddles would have to eat cat food and do cat things in order to fit in with the rest of his group. He found it very boring and Puddles was sad. Puddles didn't even look like a cat!  All of the other cats teased Puddles. "You're too big," they said. "You've got too long of a nose!" "Why are you panting like that?" Puddles knew that he was different.  One day, Puddles chose to run away from all of the cats. The cats laughed at him. What a stupid dog! Didn't he know that there were monsters in the woods that could eat him? Puddles didn't care, because Puddles was sad enough to try.  So Puddles packed up his things - his squeaky ball, his water dish, and his bone - and headed off into the woods. He was finally happy! All of a sudden, Puddles turned. He smelled a funny smell. It smelled like something he had never smelled before. He turned around, and what did he see but another dog!  Puddles was so happy, he barked with joy. He went home with the other dog, who was named Mittens, and to his family. Puddles was never lonely again.

Once upon a time there was a princess who lived in a high tower and she was not allowed to leave because of her mean mother. One day she chose to leave but her mother would not let her. The princess climbed out the window of the high tower and climbed down the south wall when her mother was sleeping. She wandered out a good ways. Finally she went into the forest where there are no electric poles but where there are some caves.  There she met a young man who was running. His name was John. John asked the princess why such a beautiful woman like her was out in the middle of a forest. She said that she had been trapped for her whole life by an evil woman who said she was her mother. The man said that he would take the princess to a castle that was near. He also said that he thought that she may be the missing princess. As they go through the forest they run into many problems.

After thinking of the best way to get there, John and the princess go to the castle where they live for the rest of their lives.

John asked the princess why such a beautiful woman like her was out in the middle of a forest. She said that she had been trapped for her whole life by an evil woman who said she was her mother. The man said that he would take the princess to a castle that was near. He also said that he thought that she may be the missing princess. As they go through the forest they run into many problems.

After thinking of the best way to get there, John and the princess go to the castle where they live for the rest of their lives.
