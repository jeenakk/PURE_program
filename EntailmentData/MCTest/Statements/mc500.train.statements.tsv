He would put grass and clovers and leaves and vines all over his cave. The other dragons were worried.  When you breathe fire, it's not a good idea to sleep around a lot of plants.  They were afraid Sean might get hurt. Sean didn't think so but his bed never stayed green and he was getting tired of doing nothing but making his bed.  One day he went to visit his friend Zarah and he saw a piece of green in a golden necklace. "What's that?" he asked.  "That's a green stone," she told him. "Sometimes my treasures have them. I don't really like them. They're too green. I like yellow things."  "If I bring you yellow things, can I have it?" Sean asked. "Yes you can," Zarah said, "But it has to be treasure, or things that won't catch fire."  So Sean went to go find treasure. When he was gone Zarah told the other dragons. They said that they would trade all their green treasure to Sean too so he could have a safe dragon bed in his cave.  Soon Sean had more than enough green stones to cover his bed.

The brothers' names were Bob, Billy, Bryan and Baker.  Each brother was one year in age.  The oldest brother Bob was nine, the second eight, the third seven and the youngest was only six.  Each boy also had something that they were good at that no one else could do.  Baker, the youngest boy was good at magic tricks. Bob was the basketball star, Billy was great at football and Bryan was good at baseball. Each boy liked to watch the others show off their skills.  One afternoon Baker put on a magic show.  For this trick he would need three things.  First, he needed four cups each a different color.  The cups colors were green, yellow, blue, and white.  He would need one white ball and two helpers which the parents happily volunteered for.  He started by showing his brothers the inside of each cup as well as the normal white ball.  He then placed the white ball inside the white cups and moved them around really fast.  Next his parents covered the four cups with a magic blanket.

This was the signal that told her third grade class to go outside and start playtime.\newline\newlineThe students in Mrs. Snooter's class always tried to get to the front of the line in order to make sure they were the first outside. As soon as the doors opened, the whole class would race to the seesaw at the back of the playground. However, it was not an easy race. There were many things between the door and the seesaw that needed to be passed, and Mrs. Snooter's third grade class enjoyed the excitement that they added to the race.\newline\newlineFirst, the students had to pass the kindergartener's sandbox. This may sound simple, but the kindergarteners would often trap students by digging large holes in the sandbox. If students jumped over the holes, they might have sand thrown in their eyes.\newline\newlineIf a student could pass the sandbox test, the next problem was the jungle gym. The fifth grade class came to recess before Mrs. Snooter's class and would hang out on top of the jungle gym. They thought they were cool because they were the oldest kids in the whole school, and would not let any other classes come near the jungle gym. It was difficult, but some students in Mrs. Snooter's class would make it past.\newline\newlineFinally, there was a long run to the seesaw. Only a few students would still be racing at this point, and they would run as fast as they could. Every day, there was one boy who would push himself a little harder than the other students.

In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly. He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true. He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm. But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted.

He met Jessica one afternoon at a park on a hot summer day.  They both started talking and became great friends.  They spent the whole day together and ate their lunches together next to the pond.  Kevin sure enjoyed the park more than he liked going to the beach or store.  There were many ducks, frogs, birds and chipmunks playing around the pond.  In fact, one of the chipmunks even came up and stole Kevin's car keys when he was eating!  Kevin knew that he needed to go have his keys, but the chipmunk ran with an evil smile on its face.  Eventually, the chipmunk ran into its hole that he called home.  Kevin tried everything he could to have the chipmunk come out with his keys, but he couldn't find out how to make the little guy give up.  Finally, Jessica came over and placed a potato chip at the opening to the hole.  In seconds, the chipmunk came out with the keys and dropped them in front of Kevin right before grabbing the chip and running back into the hole.  The chipmunk then went in to have his snack and left Kevin and Jessica alone.  Kevin thought that maybe next time he could go to the park in the early spring or winter so that the chipmunks would be busy sleeping during the cold weather months.

Whenever her parents would talk about going to the beach, she would get so excited that she couldn't sleep the night before. Tonight was one of those nights. As she lay in bed, Sally couldn't help but think of all the fun things she would be doing the next day.

Sally's mother said that they could stop for some frozen yogurt on the way since it was so hot outside. Sally and Jared both cheered. They pulled up to the shop and went inside, the cool air hitting their faces as they opened the door. There were so many different flavors!

As Timmy was running through a field in the park he came upon a small hamster with a broken leg. The hamster looked like it had somewhere to go but couldn't make it because of its leg. Timmy called Buster over to come talk to the hamster and see if there was anything they could do to help. As they talked, Timmy and Buster started to become good friends with the hamster. They found out his name was Henry. Henry was on his way to the river for a drink of water when a mean horse ran by and without looking at where he was going stepped on his leg and broke it.

There were some deer drinking water from the pond.  She picked some lilies for her mother, the queen.  The lilies were white and yellow and red.  She picked 12 lilies for her mother.  Lizzie also saw mushrooms growing in the woods.  There were birds building a nest in the bushes.  Under the bush she saw a paper cup that someone had left. There were beautiful butterflies on the bush, too. The sun was warm so she lay down to rest under the shade of a tree.  She fell asleep and as she was sleeping she had a bad dream.  She dreamed that as she was walking through the woods. In her dream she tripped over a log and hurt her ankle.

Twinkle Toes was hoping to tell Morty Roo that he would soon turn pink, but Morty Roo didn't come around to visit that day. Twinkle Toes called over Woofington, the neighbor's dog.  Twinkle Toes asked Woofington to please tell Morty Roo that he would be pink after he grew his new skin but would still be the same Twinkle Toes he had always been.  Woofington normally liked to chase Morty Roo around the neighborhood. He knew he would have to be nice to Morty Roo to deliver the message and that it would be really hard. Because it was so important to Twinkle Toes, Woofington said he would deliver the message. Woofington had a special respect for spiders because they eat other bugs.

He found an angel in his room. His grandma had always told him angels were real. Bobby had not believed her when she told him stories. She had also told him stories about mermaids, Bigfoot, leprechauns, and other things. Now, he knew at least one thing she had told him was true. He thought angel wings had to be white. This angel's feathers were many colors. They were red, blue, and green. No white ones that he could see. They looked at each other without speaking. Then, the angel began to talk. He told Bobby he had to listen to his grandma, and believe her stories. Bobby said he would. Bobby asked the angel what it was like to fly. The angel told Bobby it could show him. Bobby would have to beat it at a game. Bobby hoped it would be checkers or chess. His dad had taught him those. He was also good at card games. Instead, the angel wanted to play rock-paper-scissors. Bobby beat the angel two out of three times, so he won. Bobby and the angel then went for a long ride. After they flew, the angel dropped Bobby back at home. It told Bobby he had to promise not to tell anyone. Bobby asked if that included his grandma, mother, brother, and father. The angel said it did. Bobby said he would. The angel left.

Tony was one of the toughest leprechauns in all the land, so no one dared to mess with him or try to take his bowl. That is, until an angel named Jess fell from Heaven. Jess had broken her wing, so she had no choice but stay on Earth, and could not return to the sky.

She had heard about how tasty cereal was when she lived in Heaven, but she never tried it for herself.

What makes you think you can eat a box of cereal from my golden bowl?" The angel saw that he was right, and she couldn't argue with him. So she left to find something to trade. She came across a seesaw which looked very interesting. She thought that Tony might like it, so she brought the seesaw to his rainbow and said, "I've come bearing a seesaw."

Working at the pet shop has been my dream ever since I was a little girl, so actually getting to work with and help take care of the kitties, puppies, lizards and all sorts of animals is the coolest thing to happen to me. Some people dream of being a doctor, or a nurse, or even a teacher, but I've always wanted to work with pets. I'll say, like many people, I do have fears and that fear is snakes so I won't get to take care of them!\newline\newline\tabI arrived at the pet store around nine in the morning and was greeted by the friendly woman that owned it who I talked with over the phone. Her hair was covering her name tag so I couldn't tell if her name was Martha, Margaret, or Mary, but it turns out she told me it was Margie so none of them were right. Margie helped me become friendly with all the animals, and I had so much fun the whole day. I fed them, gave them water, and even got to play with them! Margie didn't think I was ready to clean up after them yet so she said that could be done another day.

After days and days he grew hungry and weak. When he thought for sure he was going to die a tall wizard appeared before him. The man did not know the wizard had placed a spell on him, making him get lost, but he did.\newline\newlineThe wizard smiled at the man in a friendly way and said to him, "I can show you the way out of the woods, if you give me the one thing you love most in the world."\newline\newlineSince there was nothing that the man loved, he said yes at once. The Wizard showed the man the way home and then disappeared into the wood. The man and woman lived well for many years and the man never told his meeting to the wizard and after a time, he too forgot about his promise. \newline\newlineIn time the woman gave birth and the man had a daughter who he loved. One day the wizard came to the door to take the girl, making the man remember his promise. The man was very sad to lose his daughter. But in the end he had to give her over to the wizard. The wizard was bad and locked the girl away in a cave. Every day the girl grew to be prettier and smarter.

Angel had spent a lot of time practicing her speech because she really wanted to win.  She practiced in front of her cousin, Noah.  She practiced in front of her stuffed tiger, Kitten.  She practiced saying her speech as she stood on one leg and looked at the ceiling.  She even practiced burping her speech!\newline\newlineDespite all that practice, Angel was still very nervous.  So many other kids were giving speeches that day and they all were going to try their best!  As Angel was walking in to the school she saw a penny on the ground.  Her mother had always told her that pennies were lucky so she picked it up.  With the penny in her hand she felt less nervous.  It was her new lucky coin.\newline\newlineWhen Angel's turn came she gave her speech.  She remembered all of the words to her speech and she remembered to smile at the right times.  Her hard work and her lucky coin worked.  She won the free fireworks tickets!  Angel's teacher, Mr. Coffee, was so proud of her that he turned her lucky coin into a necklace.  Angel wore it everywhere she went from then on.  The fireworks were pretty cool too.	one: What is the young girl's name?	the young girl's is name Kitten.	the young girl's is name Mr. Coffee.	the young girl's is name Noah.	the young girl's is name Angel.	multiple: What did Angel pick up off the ground?

He was going to float down the river with his friends, Dennis and Connor.  They had been building a boat out of wood Connor's father had given them for the last week.  The boys wanted to paint the boat because the brown wood did not look very good.  Josh wanted green, Dennis liked purple and Connor said it would look good if it was red.  They had to call their friend, Tonya, to help choose.  Tonya thought the same as Josh on the color so that is what they painted the boat.  To thank Tonya for helping them choose the color, the boys invited her to come with them.  All four of them carried the boat through the vegetable garden in the back yard.  They were very careful not to step on any of the carrots, potatoes or green beans.  Josh's mother had packed some food for them to eat as they floated down the river.  Everything was in a big basket.  There were peanut butter sandwiches, potato chips and cupcakes with strawberry frosting.  Each person had a job on the boat.  Josh was the captain.

Maria had worked in the past at schools in California, Texas, and Vermont, but had to leave these schools because the school in Arizona was perfect for her dream job. When she moved to Arizona she found a small little one bedroom house that fit her perfectly. The house was on the top floor of another building, owned by another teacher. In her house was a bed, dresser, table and telephone. Nothing else came with the house. So Maria wanted to go shopping with her new teacher friend. So they went down to the mall to buy things for her new house. First she wanted to look for some chairs to go with her table. Then she wanted to find a TV for her living room and a TV for her bedroom. Last she wanted to find a big comfy couch for her living room. When she got to the couch store she had a few different choices. She could buy the biggest couch they had but would go over her limit, it was black. She could buy the middle couch right at her limit, which was brown. Or she could buy the smallest couch well under her limit, but was not a very good color, red. Maria went with the middle couch knowing she would not like the color of the smaller one even if it was least expensive. Maria then had to choose if she wanted them to deliver her couch or if she would pick it up. Knowing she had only a small car she went with the deliver choice. She also had to choose if she wanted them to set up the couch for her or for her to set it up herself. She went with them setting it up since they would be there to deliver it anyway.

At camp they had lots of fun activities like swimming, wood carving, and telling ghost stories. At camp there weren't any restaurants or grocery stores, so for food they would have to make their own meals. One thing they could do is make peanut butter sandwiches, which every scout was given at the start of camp. But pretty soon everyone was sick of peanut butter sandwiches and wanted to eat something else instead. Some boys went out into the forest and picked out berries and roots that were safe to eat. Some boys even took out the boat and went fishing. They came back with a big fish that they cleaned and cooked themselves.\newline\newlineAt first, Frank's mom was very worried about letting Frank go to camp. She was worried that he could get lost in the woods and be eaten by a bear. She was worried that he might get into a fight with the other boys. She was even worried that he wouldn't shower or take a bath for the whole two weeks. But Frank's scout masters explained to Frank's mom that the camp leaders were very serious about taking care of the campers and that everything would be perfectly safe for Frank.
