 He knew that he had to check on Kate, if he did nothing else.
She was ill, with a heart problem, and he worried about her all the time.
 They both lived in a home for orphans, and he had since his parents had died, when he was the age of four.
He had taken care of Kate as if she were his sister ever since.
He wandered to her room sitting himself by her on her bed, shoving her hair from her face.
 She moved on the bed as he pulled her into his arms, &quot;Kate.&quot; He said into her ear, &quot;It's time to wake up.&quot; He pressed a kiss to her head, and her eyes opened.
 &quot;Hawthy?&quot; She said, her nickname for him moving from her lips.
 &quot;Yea.&quot; He moved her hair.
 &quot;I want to go outside today,&quot; she said, and he nodded in response.

In a far away land known as Board, there was a great man named Pawn.
This was a very odd land because the only thing to do was play chess.

Jake wanted to eat an orange.
 He liked fruit, and the only fruits in the house were apples, which he didn't like, oranges, and strawberries, which made him itchy.
 But his mother had put oranges on top of the refrigerator.
  Jake couldn't reach the top of the refrigerator.
 He got the stool that he used to reach things in the cupboards.
  But the stool wasn't tall enough on its own.
 He thought if he stood on the edge of the kitchen sink he could reach the oranges.
 (The kitchen sink was right next to the refrigerator).
So he used the stool to get up to the edge of the sink, and then he stood on the edge of the sink to get the oranges.
 He took one out of the bag and then put the bag back on top of the refrigerator.
 Then he used the stool to climb back down again with his orange.
 He sat at the kitchen table, peeled the orange, and ate it.

This may seem a bit odd.
Well, it was.
The important thing to know is that Mark wanted money.
This was so he could show off for his girl, Wendy.
Wendy had two living parents named Greg and Gail.
The exciting thing about Mark writing these stories, was that he could write whatever he wanted to.
He could have written about bears.
Or it could have been his best friend Error.
There were so many choices for Mark.

James is going to the baseball field with his friend Tommy.
 James has to practice because baseball season starts in a week.
 He wants to be a good player when the season starts.
 James has been lazy in practicing so he is not very good at baseball right now.
 He has to make up for it by playing baseball for 5 hours every day for a week.
 James thinks this is enough practice for him to catch up and be a good player when the season starts.
 So James and Tommy practice every day.
 They throw the ball around.
 They practice batting and they practice fielding.
 Tommy begins to see that James is getting better every day.
 He says &quot;I do not believe it, James, but I think you are going to be pretty good when the season starts!&quot;  Usually a week is not enough time to get pretty good at baseball but James is practicing so much he is fitting a month of practice into one week.
 Then James has a setback.
 His glove rips during practice.
 He can't keep playing with a broken glove!
 So Tommy and James go around town collecting bottles to trade in for five cents for each bottle.
 James misses a day of practicing but they find enough bottles to turn in for thirty dollars.
 This is enough money for James to buy a new glove!
 So James buys a new glove and he and Tommy go back to the field and practice some more.
 By the time the season comes James is one of the best players on his team.
Flying a kite can be dangerous.
When I was eight years old I went to the park with my dad to fly my new kite.
We stood on the top of a hill and tried to catch the wind.
It took us almost half an hour, but we finally got the kite into the air.
As it lifted into the sky, the kite caught the edge of my jacket and I was pulled up into the wind with the kite.
I flew higher and higher into the air until I my dad looked like an ant on the ground.
The park was beautiful from up high, and I could see our car getting smaller.
I flew all the way out of the city and over the lake.
Eventually, the wind started to die down and I fell closer to the water.
I called out to some people on a boat and they sailed over so I could land on their boat.
I told them about my adventure and they sailed me back to land, where my dad picked me up.
He took me out for ice cream and we went home.

The first grade class went on a bus to visit a farm.
The farm was a long ways from their school.
The farm was also far away from any other farms or houses.
The farmers who lived there were the Nixon family.
They grew corn.
Sometimes when the weather was right, they would plant wheat, too.
The fields were so large that the class could not see where they ended.
Mr.
Nixon gave all of the children a long ride in the fields on his tractor.
The Nixon family also had a lot of farm animals.
In the red barn next to their home, they kept a few cows and horses.
Everyone fed hay to some of the cows.
The farmers got milk from their cows.
Some of the class got small bottles of fresh milk to take home with them.
All the kids got to ride on the big brown horses the Nixons had.
They went up into the nearby hills, where they could look down on the farm below.
Around the farmyard there were many goats and chickens, who wandered around as they wished.
The Nixon children liked to play with their goats, feed them peanut shells and pet them, like the first grade kids did with their dogs and cats.
The smallest tried to bump the children with their hard heads and tiny horns!
When it was almost dark, the school kids got back on the bus to go home.
They were a little sad to leave the fun life of the farm children.
But they brought back stories for all the rest of the school to hear.

 There, we went to a special place.
 We went to the zoo!
 I saw lots of animals at the zoo.
 I saw bears.
 I saw tigers.
 I saw apes.
 I saw monkeys.
 I saw snakes.
 I loved seeing all these animals.
 They made me happy.
 We even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn't even scare me.
 In fact, I like bugs.
 But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there were lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.
 You could buy sugar water to feed them and they could land on you.
 My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but I was scared.
 I wasn't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying everywhere.
 My mom said I would be okay.
 My brother said I would be okay.
 They said butterflies were nice and beautiful.
 They said they would not hurt me.
 So I went in the room.
 Guess what?
 I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door!
The man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me to stop.
 He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.
 I said I was sorry, but I was scared.
 He checked me for butterflies and then let me get out of there!
 I stayed outside and my mom and my brother enjoyed the butterflies.
 Since then, they would tease me about being afraid.
 They would try and get me to not be afraid.
 Last year for my birthday, mom bought me a butterfly book.
 She bought one for my brother, too.
 I tried really hard to not be afraid and to go out into the yard and find butterflies with my brother.
 It became really fun to do.
 Once, a butterfly landed on me and I laughed.
 I liked it.
 It tickled me.
 It did not hurt me.
 Now, I like butterflies!

Chocolate was a box turtle.
 Lauren found her one day on the side of the road, hiding in her old, worn shell, frightened by the cars going by.
 Lauren picked Chocolate up to help her cross the street, because Lauren knew that turtles are very slow and cars are very fast.
 After Lauren got Chocolate to the other side of the road, Chocolate peeked her head out of her shell and looked at the little girl.
 Lauren saw that not only was Chocolate's shell worn, one of her eyes was shut.
 Lauren thought Chocolate needed more help from her, so Lauren took the turtle home.
 Lauren hid Chocolate in her bathtub, because she was worried that her mother would be mad.
Lauren went to look up what turtles like to eat and left Chocolate alone in the bathtub.
 Lauren was still looking up  turtle facts when she heard her mother call out, &quot;Lauren, get in here now!&quot;  Lauren knew she was in trouble.
 But when Lauren came into the bathroom, her mother was smiling.
 Lauren's mom told her that she had a turtle when she was a little girl.
 Lauren and her mom took Chocolate to an animal doctor who treated sick turtles.
 The doctor gave them special drops to put in Chocolate's eyes.
 Lauren put the drops in Chocolate's eyes, like the doctor told her and soon the turtle's eyes were all better.
Chocolate's shell was still old and worn looking, like an old shoe, but now her eyes were beautiful, like the golden jewels on Grandma's earrings.
Lauren was glad that she helped Chocolate.

Cats walked and talked much as you do except they walked on four legs.
There were cat policemen, cat firemen, cat teachers, and even a cat bus driver.
Most of the cats were very busy.
    The King of Catatonia was a small cat named Diggs.
He had two brothers named Pouncer and Flash who helped him rule in Catatonia.
Pouncer was head of the Milk, Cheese and Cream center and Flash's job was to blow things up.
Together the three of them made sure all the cats were happy, had plenty to drink and got to enjoy bright fireworks shows in the distance.

They were nowhere to be seen.
 Later that night, when their walk was over, Jeff and Forrest were lying on the bed.
They were watching a television show about ghosts.

He barked.
 Jeff smiled.
He liked that his dog always saw things the same way he did.

He said that little girls needed to laugh and play, not sew all the time.

&quot;No more sewing, Mary!&quot; He said.
He wanted her to go laugh and play with her friends instead of sew but instead of going outside to play she ran into her room and cried.
Mary was very sad that she couldn't sew any more.
Soon her friends came over to see why Mary hadn't come over to play like her father said she would.
When they saw her crying on her bed they had to think of a way to cheer her up.
Billy said that maybe they could let her sew at their houses.
Abby thought it was a great idea.
So then all Mary's friends bought sewing things with their money so that Mary would be happy again.
When Mary's father saw Mary go to one of her friend's house he was very happy.
Soon everyone was happy again.

Cindy had been invited to it, but Mary had not.
This hurt Mary's feelings a lot.
The girls kept on playing and Mary was trying to have fun, but all she felt like doing was crying.
She couldn't believe that she had not been invited to Allison's birthday party.
She thought that they were friends and if her best friend Cindy had been invited, why not her?
 After recess was over, the class walked back into the school.
Mary saw Allison in line and tried to smile, but it was hard.
Cindy felt horrible now that she had talked about the party that her friend was not going to.
 Mary found it hard to pay attention to the teacher now.
She kept thinking over and over why Allison didn't invite her to the party.
Did Mary do something to make Allison mad or to hurt her?
She couldn't understand it.
Her eyes started to get wet with tears.
She was hoping that no one saw this.
Mary thought she saw Allison looking at her in a funny way.
Suddenly Mary felt like she was going to start crying.
She reached into her desk to pull out some tissues.
She felt a strange  piece of paper.
She pulled it out and there was the invitation to Allison's party.
It had gotten mixed up in her papers in her desk.
She immediately started to smile.
She smiled at Allison and at Cindy.
Cindy gave her a puzzled look because she thought that Mary was sad.
  At lunch Mary explained everything to Cindy.
Then Mary, Allison, and Cindy all went off to play.
A boy named Eduardo in a far away place is thinking about a girl he loves.
 He is cold.
It is snowing where he lives.
He lives in Argentina.
 It's warm where she lives in Hawaii.
She eats fresh fruit.
 Her shower is outdoors under the warm sun as red birds fly around her.
It is nice, but she misses him.
 She remembers he is very pretty.
She wondered if he would really love her always,  because she is older.
 He didn't care.
Eduardo was poor, so he could not visit her.
  Maybe a time machine would help!!
She can give back her birthdays!
But she didn't want to bring back any dinosaurs back by accident.
Like last time.
 Then an angel flew down from a star called the Pleiades to help her.
His name was Eh.
He said, &quot;close your eyes!
Then remember the most happy you have ever felt!
Let go of any thing that feels like clouds.
Imagine puppies hugging you, and kitties purring with you.
Imagine you are eating chocolate ice cream!
 As long as you remember how to be happy  you can ALWAYS be as young as Eduardo!
And you can think of GREAT ways you can see him again!&quot;  It worked!
She had an idea.
Someone in a place called MR was buying stories that people wrote.
She wrote one about her &amp; Eduardo!
 It paid for her airplane ride.
Wow.
 Then they were together again.
Hugging each other in happiness, they said, &quot;Thank you everyone,  for helping us!&quot;

  And Freddy loved his mom very much, and his mom loved him very much too.
 One day, Freddy went outside to ride his bike.
 On the way out, his mother told him, &quot;Remember to wear your helmet,&quot; and Freddy grabbed his helmet and met his friends outside.
 When he was putting on his helmet, his friends told him, &quot;Helmets are for girls!
 You're not cool if you wear a helmet!&quot;  Freddy thought about what his mom told him, but he wanted to be cool like his friends, and he took off his helmet.
 Freddy and his friends went on a long adventure, and they rode all the way to the top of the largest hill in their neighborhood.
 Looking down, Freddy was scared.
 He had never ridden down this hill before.
 His friends said, &quot;What are you, scared?&quot;  Freddy did not want to come off as scared.
 He hopped on his bicycle, and down he went.
 Freddy started speeding up, going very, very fast.
 He pressed his brakes, but oh no, his brakes weren't working.
 Freddy, speeding down the hill, did not know what to do.
 He got to the end of the hill and slammed right into a tree.
 He awoke the next day in the hospital.
 At the hospital, his mother was there.
 Freddy opened his eyes and told his mom the whole story.
 He told her how we would never do that again, and how he would always wear his helmet.
 His mom gave him a big kiss on the forehead, and Freddy knew his mother was right in the beginning.
 She didn't have to say it.
 In the end, Freddy learned that it's important to not care what other people think, and those that think you're not cool because you wear a helmet are the ones that aren't cool in the first place.

Francis was grey and white and had messy fur.
Winston was black and very fat.
They were very happy rabbits who loved to eat.
Every day they would leave their home, cross a road, and go through a small forest to get to a meadow of grass.
They loved to eat that grass.
One day, Chester thought he smelled something interesting.
At first he thought it might be dirt.
Then he thought maybe some sort of flower.
So, he asked a nearby squirrel.
The squirrel's name was Acorn.
Acorn said that he thought it was mushrooms.
However, Francis, the smartest rabbit, went to go look, and he learned that it was actually a garden of carrots.

Late in the evening, the wind blew hard around the little house.
The sound of the wind is like someone crying.
It made the old woman nervous.
She had not been getting much sleep lately, but with the wind making the spooky noise, she didn't know what else to do but lie down and try to rest a little.
 Once she lay down to try to sleep, many memories of her life in the little house kept her mind busy.
She still was having trouble falling asleep.
She remembered being a little girl and her dad putting the finishing touches on the house.
Her mom loved the big kitchen, and she and her younger sister had their own room in the back.
 It was in this, her old bedroom, that she was trying to sleep.
The crying sound got louder.
It didn't seem like it was outside.
It sounded like it was coming from the other side of the bed.
When she turned and looked, she saw her younger sister.
She still looked five years old.
The old woman couldn't remember her any other way, as she had died from a sickness at age five.
 &quot;What's wrong?&quot; she asked her sister.
&quot;I miss you.
I am so lonely,&quot; answered the little girl, who was so thin you could see through her.
The old lady closed her eyes and reached for her sister.
That is how they found her the next day, holding her pillow and smiling.
 &quot;She died in her sleep.&quot; &quot;It is best that way.&quot;
A little boy named Joey did not like to brush his teeth.
One day, as his mother asked him to brush his teeth, Joey said, &quot;I don't want to!
It's gross and a waste of time!&quot; In response, Joey's mom told him that in order for him to grow up and be big and strong like she is, he must brush his teeth.
In disgust, with his mom watching to make sure he brushed his teeth right, he brushed his teeth and whined until he was finished.
The next day, Joey did not brush his teeth and told his mom that he did.
After going to school, one of Joey's friends said that his breath stunk and began to make fun of him.
This made Joey very angry, so he pushed the boy over and started to cry.
A teacher came over and called the principal as both kids were being loud and starting a fight.
Joey's mom came to school and took him home.
After asking what was wrong, Joey told his mom that he didn't brush his teeth.
After hearing this, his mom marched him up to the bathroom and forced him to brush his teeth.
&quot;You won't get teased if you brush your teeth, Joey!&quot; she yelled, and then left the room.
From that day forward, Joey brushed his teeth every day so the other kids wouldn't make fun of him.

 &quot;It's a ball of yarn.
On the top shelf!&quot; said Snowball.
She had seen the yarn that was kept in a basket up there!
 &quot;That looks like it's fun to play with!&quot; said Fuzzy.
&quot;But how could we get to it?
It's so high up,&quot; he wondered.
 &quot;I have an idea,&quot; said Snowball.
&quot;Watch this!&quot; Suddenly, Snowball jumped up on to the couch.
 &quot;What are  you doing?&quot; asked Fuzzy.
 &quot;Just watch!&quot; said Snowball.
Snowball then jumped to the table next to the couch.
Then, she jumped to the middle shelf.
 &quot;That's dangerous!&quot; said Fuzzy.
Snowball and Fuzzy were still small kittens.
They weren't used to jumping very high yet.
 &quot;Don't worry, I'll be careful.
I think we're allowed to be up here.&quot; said Snowball.
Then, she jumped all the way to the top shelf, where the yarn was.
&quot;Look out below!&quot; she yelled, and pushed the ball of yarn off the shelf and on to the floor.
 &quot;Whoa!&quot; said Fuzzy.
&quot;Thanks!&quot; Snowball then jumped down to the middle shelf, and down to the table, and down to the couch, and back to the floor.

He thought to himself, &quot;I guess I won't ever see the brown puppy again.
I hoped to see him again.&quot; A nice young lady said to James, &quot;Would you like a puppy?&quot; James said, &quot;I would like a puppy that was like the one I petted before.&quot; The lady smiled.

The best afternoon I ever had with my grandfather was when we went down to the river and fished.
 It was a hot July day, and I was bored.
My grandfather was sitting in the backyard, reading.
&quot;Hey, you look like you need some fun,&quot; he said.
 &quot;Want to go fishing?&quot; I said sure, and he went to the garage.
 He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some fishing line.
Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together.
 I asked if we needed worms, and he said no.
Then, we set off to the river.
 It was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve.
They used to catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner.
 When we got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned and walked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees right at the edge of the park.
There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water.
Then we sat down to wait.
While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about what he and Steve did as kids.
We didn't have any worms, so we never caught any fish, but sitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon.

 Billy would put the bowl down and wait for Tumble to come up to the bowl to eat from it.
When Tumble reached the bowl, he put his nose on it.
 But, the oatmeal was too hot to eat.
 Billy reached down and blew on the hot oatmeal, to cool it down for Tumble to eat.
 Once the oatmeal was cool enough, Tumble could dig in and eat his big bowl of oatmeal.
 Billy loved to watch as Tumble ate his bowl of oatmeal, because Billy took good care of Tumble, everyday.

On a snowy winter morning, the brown-haired lady saw a squirrel that was hurt.
It only had three legs, and it looked hungry.
She put some corn out for the squirrel to eat, but other bully squirrels came, too.
The brown-haired lady started giving the little squirrel peanuts to eat.
She gave some to the bully squirrels, too, so they would leave the three-legged squirrel alone.
 The winter snow melted and then it was spring.
The grass turned green and the air was warm.
Now, when the little squirrel with three legs would come to see the brown-haired lady with the peanuts, it would take the peanuts and dig a little hole and hide the peanuts for later.
The squirrel would hold the peanut in its mouth and dig and dig and dig, and then it would put the peanut in the hole and pat it down with its little front paw.
Then it would run back over to the brown-haired lady and get some more peanuts to eat.

I entered the store and said hi to Mr.
Jones.
He had been working at the store for a long time.
I walked to the back of the store and picked up some cold sodas and a bottle of orange juice.
I then went and picked up some popcorn.
This would be good for eating later while watching tv.
I then went to the dog food section and picked a meat treat for the dog.
I then went up to the front of the store and paid Mr.
Jones.
He smiled and thanked me for shopping at his store.
Then I walked back to my house and looked at the dog.
His name was Rex and had lived with us for around four years.
His coat was brown and white.

 After they had heated up the oven, they put the chicken and the pan on the center oven rack and set the timer.
 Then, as they peeled potatoes and carrots to go with the chicken, Amy, Joe and Cindy talked about dinner.
 Amy said, &quot;Joe, this is too much food for you, me and little Cindy to eat in one night.
We'll have leftovers.
 What can we do with the leftover chicken?&quot;  Joe said, &quot;We could make chicken sandwiches or chicken and rice.&quot;  Amy said, &quot;How about chicken soup?&quot;  Cindy said, &quot;I like chicken with Thai noodles with red peppers.
 We haven't made those in a long time.&quot;   &quot;That sounds good,&quot; said Amy.
 &quot;We'll make that for dinner tomorrow.&quot;  &quot;Yum!&quot; said Joe.
 &quot;That's a great idea.
 I love Thai noodles.&quot;  Later, Joe, Amy and Cindy had finished eating dinner, and Cindy asked Amy for help with her homework.
 &quot;I don't understand how to do these math problems!&quot;  Joe said, &quot;You two go ahead.
 I'll do the dishes and put away the leftovers.&quot;  Soon, Cindy went into the kitchen to get a glass of water.
 Joe was eating the chicken.
It was almost gone!

We can't have Thai noodles with chicken tomorrow.&quot;  Joe looked very sad.

Eliza had difficulties doing both her schoolwork and her dancing; she often fell behind in math.
Her best friend Maddy was also a dancer; they often competed with each other to get the top parts in the dances.
Their moms thought that because they competed with each other they might become mean towards one another but they did not let that get in the way of their friendship.
 In their latest recital Eliza had got the top part in the dance called &quot;The Beauty and the Rain&quot;.
The hours were long and draining on their bodies.
All the girls and boys who left the performance center looked so tired.
They couldn't pick up their practice bags off of the floor as they walked to their parents to go home and their eyelids were droopy.
When Eliza got home, the last thing on her mind was her math problems.
All she could think of was bathing her sore feet and her head hitting her soft fluffy pillow.
 Her teachers started to become aware of Eliza's problems in the classroom and called her parents into school to talk to her teachers.
Her parents knew that dancing was Eliza's dream and would not let anything get in the way of her performances.
It was important for her parents for Eliza to do well in all parts of her life, but her dancing is what lit a fire in her eyes.
Her parents got her extra help to help with her homework, which helped Eliza keep track of all parts of her life.

The family across the street has a cat.
He is a cute black kitty named Dillon.
The cat is about two years old, and the family has had him for about a year.
He is an indoor cat who is not allowed to go outside.
The children like to play with Dillon because he still acts like a kitten.
Dillon jumps around, and chases flies, beetles and spiders.
When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn't try to hurt them with his claws.
Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread.
The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes.
But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can.
Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away.
He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers.
The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns.
The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread.
They yell at him when he walks on the table.
But Dillon does not listen.
The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat.
The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook, and that's why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much!

I am glad that we get to be awake through all the seasons.
 I like spring.
I like fall.
I like winter.
My favorite time of all is, for sure, summer!

His parents wanted him to pick a good one because playing an instrument was very important to them.
So, the boy went to a music store with his parents.
When he got there he didn't know where to start, so the boy walked up to the front and asked the man who worked there for help.
First the worker brought the boy to a piano.
&quot;No way,&quot; said the boy, &quot;that looks way too hard!&quot; The worker laughed at this, and then brought out a guitar.

Finally, the worker brought the boy to the drums.
&quot;That's it!
That is a cool instrument that I could really get into.&quot; However, his mom wasn't so happy with this because she thought that he would be too loud.

Abby and Emma are outside one day to do something special for someone.
They are picking flowers for their mother's birthday.
  Right before they are finished picking their flowers to surprise their mother, the girls see that the clouds in the sky have turned grey and that the sun is no longer shining.
It looks like it's going to rain soon.
 Abby looks down at her small hand of purple flowers and frowns.
 &quot;What's wrong, Abby?&quot; Emma asks, turning to look at her sister studying her flowers.
  &quot;Well,&quot; Abby says, &quot;We got the flowers, but it looks like rain.&quot;  Emma looks up at the cloudy sky and nods.
 &quot;If it rains, we can't make mommy a mud pie,&quot; Abby adds with sadness.
  Emma looks down at her own white flowers, counting them, and thinks.
After making sure she had four flowers, she looks at Abby with an idea.
  &quot;What if we get the mud and take it in the house?
That way if it rains, we can still make a cake,&quot; Emma says.
  &quot;Good idea!&quot; Abby smiles, happy again.
  Flowers in hand, the girls grab a yellow pail, placing their flowers on the porch, as they walk towards the mud to get what they need for their mother's birthday cake.
I am very hungry.
I look for my mother.
 When is dinner?
I ask.
 Dinner is at six, my mother says.
 What can we eat?
I ask.
 We can pick food from our garden, she says.
I help her pick corn, beans, and peas.
 The corn is yellow and white.
The beans are small and brown.
The peas are green and round.
 I put the beans in a basket.

The water is warm.
My hands are now clean.
 Mother lets me stir the beans.

Years back in a kingdom far away there lived a family in the woods.
 This family had always lived in the woods.
 Their father each day would travel into the woods and chop wood to take to the town.
 The mother spent her day cleaning and taking care of their home and her three children.
 The dad and his family had a good life.
 They never wanted for much.
The three kids went to school and had many friends in the town.
One day there came a nasty storm to the woods.
 This storm brought a lot of rain and flooded many areas in the city.
 Many homes were under water.
 The leader came to the dad and asked him to go out and cut some very large logs to place in the city to keep the water back.
 The logs would be used to build a wall.
The dad took his kids and his wife into the woods and cut down the largest trees they could find.
 In the end the town was saved because of the wall and for their work the dad and his family were paid and could build a bigger home and had more children.

They ended up becoming good friends and had many play dates together over the months ahead.

They were glad that they met in the toy store and became life-long friends.

So, he asked his mom to come help him out.
First he got a doughnut.
&quot;That's not good for you at all!&quot; said his mom.
So, his mom got a big bag of broccoli.
&quot;Yuk, I hate the taste of broccoli,&quot; said the boy.
They looked and looked and couldn't find anything that looked good to the boy that was also good for him.
Finally, they saw the perfect thing: some grilled chicken from the party on the weekend.
It was so delicious the first time, and it tasted great cold for lunch.

 &quot;Can we pet her?&quot; Anna asked.
 &quot;Be careful,&quot; Mom said.
Anna knew these directions were for her brother, who was often rough with things.
 &quot;She's fat,&quot; John giggled.
 &quot;She's not fat.
She's pregnant,&quot; Mom told him.
 &quot;What's that mean?&quot; John asked.
 &quot;It means she's going to have kittens.&quot; Anna said.
&quot;Can we keep her?&quot; Anna begged.
&quot;Please?&quot;  Mom and Dad looked at each other.
 &quot;We could take her to the pound, or she could stay outside here,&quot; Mom said.
&quot;Long-haired cats give you rashes.&quot;  &quot;But you always said you wanted one,&quot; Dad told Mom.
&quot;Short-haired cats don't bother me, and if she stays here, we have to give the kittens away.
Let's send her over to your parents' farm.
She can live in the barn, and then if one of the kittens has short hair, we can keep that one.&quot;  The kids were excited.
They named the cat Socks because she had white feet, and they went to visit her every day.
Socks had her kittens in April, and, to everyone's excitement, two of them had short hair.

Once upon a time, there was a giraffe named Scoop.
He was a very friendly giraffe and he was cute, too.
He had beautiful orange and yellow markings and he loved to play with his friends, but Scoop had a problem.
His neck was really short, so he could not reach the tall plants and his mommy and daddy had to get all of his food for him.
 One day, Scoop's friend Scap, invited him over for a sleepover party.
It sounded like so much fun, but Scoop was too embarrassed.
He didn't want everyone to laugh at him at feeding time when he couldn't reach the food by himself, so he said he could not come to the party  Scap was a really good friend and he knew that Scoop wanted to come to the party, so he came up with a plan.
 That afternoon, Scap gathered all the little giraffes in the neighborhood and they spent the day together collecting food.
They then went to Scoop's house and showed him all the food they had gathered for the party and once again invited him along.
He happily said yes and they all had a wonderful time.
On a sunny day in July, Sylvia left the front gate open.
From the spot where Rex was napping in the grassy yard, he had listened to the sound of the gate sliding open, and waited for it to snap shut.
It didn't.
The click of Sylvia's shoes faded into the distance, and yet the snap of the shutting gate didn't come.
Finally, Rex pushed himself up on one paw so he could look towards the front of the yard, where the gate moved in the breeze.
Rex moved slowly towards the gate at first, but as he neared the sidewalk he shot through the opening, his shiny black fur twinkling in the sun as he sped down the street.
Rex ran from block to block through the neighborhood, with no leash to pull him back.
When all four legs started to burn from running, Rex slowed down and started sniffing the grass around him.
His stomach growled and he hoped he'd find some food in the grass.
All he found was sidewalk chalk, a few little black ants, and flowers that made him sneeze.
The sun was going down, and Rex thought about Sylvia coming home to rub his ears and fill his food bowl.
He looked up and down the sidewalk for his home.
Nothing.
Rex was lost.
He stood completely still and raised his ears as high as they would go.
He sat and listened, and listened and sat.
Just as the sun passed over the mountains in the distance, Rex heard, from very far away, the soft &quot;click click click&quot; of Sylvia walking towards the house.
Rex ran home.
When Sophie woke up that morning, she had no idea where her day was going to take her.
She rolled out of bed, turned off her alarm and stretched.
She wasn't feeling like herself that morning, but she wasn't sure why.
Sophie thought to herself, &quot;I slept well, I ate good food yesterday, and yet I still felt strange&quot;.
Sophie stepped into the shower feeling so tired.
As she toweled herself off and got dressed, she felt like she was moving very slowly.
She went to the kitchen and poured herself a glass of orange juice, got a bowl out of the cabinet and filled it with cereal.
As Sophie sat at the table to eat her breakfast, she remembered why she wasn't feeling like herself.
She remembered that she didn't exercise the day before.
She had spent much of the day sitting in front of her television and playing games.
Sophie knew that on days that she didn't exercise, she always felt bad the next day.
Sophie thought for a second, and then looked at the clock.
She had time to do some jumping jacks and run outside around her house before she had to leave for the day.
She put on her running shoes and went out the front door.
After only a quick bit of exercise, Sophie was feeling much better.
She promised herself that she would never forget to exercise again.

When I was a little boy, I could remember my mom making breakfast and dinner for us.
And I remember one night, when she had made dinner after a long, hard day at work.
On that evening, my mom placed a plate of vegetables, salad and burned chicken breast in front of my dad.
I remember waiting to see if anyone saw, yet all my dad did was to reach for his chicken breast, smile at mom and ask me how my day was at school.
I don't remember what I told him that night, but I do remember watching him drop hot sauce on that chicken breast and eat every bite.
 When I got up from the table that evening, I remember hearing my mom apologize to my dad for burning the chicken breast.
I'll never forget what he said.
&quot;Dear, I love burnt chicken breast.&quot;  Later that night, I went to kiss daddy good night and I asked him if he really liked his chicken breast burnt.
He put his arms around me and said &quot;Dear, your momma put in a hard day at work today and she's real tired and a little burnt chicken breast never hurt anyone.&quot;
Tony was riding his bike home from school.
 Then he saw Cindy riding her bike in front of him.
   Tony yelled, &quot;Hey, Cindy!&quot;  Then he rode faster to catch up with her.
  Cindy said, &quot;Tony!
Hey!
 Where are you going?&quot;  &quot;I'm going to the empty lot on Maple Street to ride my bike.
 The other kids are going to be there.
 Do you want to come?&quot;  &quot;Sure,&quot; said Cindy.
 Tony and Cindy rode to Maple Street, to the empty lot.
 The empty lot did not have a house on it.
 Instead, it had big hills of dirt, and it had trees cut down on the ground.
 There was a low part that became a pond after it rained.
 The lot had been empty for a couple of years, because times were bad and the builder couldn't find a buyer for another house.
 The kids had ridden their bikes over the hills of dirt, around the cut trees, and through the muddy pond.
There were bike trails all over the empty lot.
 There were even places where the kids could jump their bikes.
   There were three other children riding their bikes at the empty lot when Tony and Cindy arrived: Lana, Billy and Chris.
  Cindy said, &quot;I am calling my mom to let her know that I'm here.&quot;    Tony said, &quot;That's a good idea.
 Can I use your phone when you're done?&quot;  Cindy said &quot;Sure!
 Keep it for now.
 I'm going to go on the jump path.
 I was scared to try it last time.
 I don't want to break my phone if I fall.
 I'm leaving my backpack here, too.&quot;  &quot;Okay.&quot; said Tony.
 &quot;I'll watch.
 You'll do good.&quot;

 Mommy didn't look mad, but Jamal knew that she was disappointed.
   The next day, Jamal's dad drove him to school.
 Jamal said &quot;Daddy, did Mommy not like your birthday card?&quot;    Jamal's dad said, &quot;Well, son, sometimes I don't know what your mother likes.
 I could have asked her or thought of something better.&quot;    Before Jamal got out of the car, he asked his dad, &quot;Can we go to get ice cream after you pick me up from school?&quot;    &quot;Sure, that sounds good to me,&quot; said Jamal's dad.
 After school, Jamal and his dad went to the ice cream shop.
Jamal said, &quot;Now we can get Mommy the present!&quot;    Jamal's dad said, &quot;What present?
 Did you have a secret plan?&quot;    Jamal giggled and ran to the plant store nearby.
 Jamal remembered that when Mommy took him to his grandma's house, she told Grandma that she always wanted to have a lily plant.
 They found a lily plant in the store.
 The woman who worked at the store asked, &quot;Do you want to put this in a pot?&quot;    Jamal's dad told Jamal, &quot;Let's get the yellow pot, because that's Mommy's favorite color.&quot;    When they got home, Jamal's mommy came out of the kitchen.
 She saw the lily in the bright yellow pot on the table.
 Jamal saw her smile, only this time it was the same smile he saw when he gave her the card.
 Jamal smiled too because he knew that Daddy made her very happy.

I'm sorry I cannot help you.
Go visit the humans.
Sometimes I tip over their garbage cans at night when I am looking for food.

Their school is having a guessing game to guess how many gumballs are in a box.
If they get the right amount they win $100.
If they get close they get a $20 gift card.
The box looks like it is missing some gumballs.
It turns out some people are eating them when they place their guess.
100 people guessed and took a piece of candy.
The box is 10&quot; by 10&quot; by 10&quot;.
Each gumball is 1&quot; each.
Mike guessed 500.
Jeff guessed 800.
They both said they would split their money they win, if they win.
Hannah and her friend Mary were bored.
 They sat around the house and tried to think about what to do.
 They petted the cat.
 They drew pictures in Hannah's notebook.
 They snuck into Hannah's mother's closet to try on her shoes, but Hannah's mother caught them.
 She said, &quot;You girls need something to do.
 Let's take a walk to the park!&quot; Hannah and Mary looked at each other, and then jumped up and down happily.
 &quot;The park sounds great!&quot; said Hannah.
 &quot;Let's go!&quot; cried Mary.
 So Hannah's mother packed up a snack of apples and cookies, and they all set off to walk to the park.
 They walked down the sidewalk, looking at all the interesting things along the way.
 Mary spotted a squirrel.
 Hannah saw a yellow bird.
 Hannah's mother pointed out the pretty yellow flowers growing in front of Mr.
Smith's house.
 When they got to the park, Hannah's mother spread out a picnic blanket and the snack.
 Hannah and Mary ran around chasing butterflies for a little time, and then sat down to eat their snacks.
 When they finished, Hannah's mother put the leftovers in a trash can.
 As they walked back home, Hannah thought that the boring day had turned out quite well.
Douglas loves to play soccer.
He plays for the Dolphins.
He is very good.
 He was excited about the big game with the Lions.
 The night before the game, he went to bed late.
 He was watching three TV shows that night.
 First, was Muffins the Cat.
 The second show was Ernie the Talking Donkey.
 The third was Laughing with Herman Hamster.
 His Mom told him to go to bed, but Douglas didn't listen.
 He fell asleep on the couch.
He dreamed all night.
 First about sheep jumping fences.
 Second about playing fetch the ball with Ruffles.
Third about Ernie the talking Donkey kicking a soccer ball over the moon.
Fourth about his favorite soccer player, Pele, head the ball in the goal.
 Finally, the next morning, Douglas got up late because he was so tired.
 His Mom called him and the alarm went off, but he did not hear.
To get Douglas up, his Mom got Ruffles the dog to lick him in the face.
 Douglas got up but had to eat breakfast fast.
 Then he quickly dressed into his uniform.
 He was yawning.
 His Mom drove him to the soccer field.
 The game had started.
 Douglas had to sit out the first quarter.
 His team was losing one to nothing when Howard scored for the Lions.
Douglas started the second quarter.
 He was tired and could not keep up with the rest of his team.
 The coach was surprised that Douglas was so slow.
 Usually he was fast.
 After the second quarter, the Dolphins were losing two to one after Howard scored again for the Lions and Toby scored a goal for the Dolphins.
While the coach gave energy drinks to the team, Douglas fell asleep.
 The third quarter started.
 Douglas was snoring when the coach told him to go in.
 When he saw Douglas was sleeping, he sent Billy into the game.
 Billy scored one goal and the Dolphins had tied the game two to two.
 Ruffles the dog started barking and then licking Douglas in the face.
 Douglas got up and stretched.
 He was finally well rested.
 The coach saw Douglas and sent him into the game.
 Douglas remembered his dream.
 In the last second, he headed the ball in the goal like Pele.
He won the game.
The team cheered.
 Since that time, Douglas goes to bed on time.
 He always wants to be well rested.
 His Mom was right.
 He gave her a hug.
I'm here to tell you the story of a robot named Carl.
He came from a far away land known as Factory.
Carl was sad because he was missing a part called a tire.
He also needed a sun gatherer.
But, the tire was more important.
Once Carl got all these parts he could travel to his new home in the nation of Lab and the city of Office.
It was a tricky thing to get there with missing parts.
Just as he had given up hope Carl got a message from Mr.
X saying the new parts were ready to be delivered.
This made the robot very happy.
The parts arrived a few days later and Carl put them in with 2 days of work.
After this Carl began to travel the last bit of his goal to get to his new job.
After this Carl took 10 days to get to Lab.
On a hot summer day, Brian was walking home from the park.
While walking, Brian passed his favorite toy store, and saw that they had a new baseball glove in the window.
 Brian's baseball glove was very old and was ripped in a few places.
 Brian really wanted the new glove because he wanted to show off his glove to his friends tomorrow.
The cost of the new glove was fifteen dollars, but when Brian checked his pockets for money, he only had six dollars and fifty cents.
 Brian ran home and went to look around his house for money.
He checked under his bed and found fifty cents under some toys.
 He then checked all of his pockets of his pants and shorts, and found another two dollars.
 Brian then went to look between the cushions on all of the couches in his house, and he found another three dollars.
 After finally looking around his whole house, Brian knew that he still did not have enough money to buy the new glove.
 Brian went outside and saw his dad doing yard work.
He told his dad that he would finish all the yard work for him, if he could have the money he needed for the new glove.
 His dad said yes, so Brian spent the rest of the afternoon raking the yard, and bagging leaves.
 Brian's dad was very proud that his son was working hard for money.
When Brian was finally done, Brian knew that he was too late, and the toy store was closed.
 Just as Brian was walking inside, he saw his dad walk up to home holding the new glove that he wanted.
 Brian was so happy, and he and his dad spent the rest of the afternoon having a catch.
On a nice and sunny day, Bob and Sally walked to the beach.
When they got there, the first thing they wanted to do was to look for buried treasure.
To find the treasure they had brought two shovels and two buckets.
They both started digging holes in the sand with their shovels.
After looking very hard for treasure for an hour, they didn't find anything.
This made Bob and Sally very sad.
They gave up and went to play in the water.
While they were playing in the water, Sally found a bottle with a little paper inside.
Sally opened the bottle and found a treasure map.
Sally showed the map to Bob and they started to look for the treasure.
 After walking every step that the map said, they started digging with their shovels.
After digging a really a big hole, they found a box.
They were very happy that they found it and wanted to see what was inside.
Bob slowly opened the box and there was a very big pearl.
 Next, they ran to a special store to ask about the pearl.
The worker in the store told Bob and Sally that the pearl could make them rich.
Bob and Sally looked at each other and decided not to sell it.
They took the pearl home and saved it in a special box, so they could remember their day at the beach.
It was a beautiful sunny and warm day.
I was working outside in my garden.
I was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day.
I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake.
It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake.
 On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake.
I got up from my garden and walked to the lake.
I kept hearing this strange sound.
It sounded like someone talking in a very low voice.
I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time.
The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to &quot;say&quot; to other lake birds.
There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short.
Then there is the &quot;where are you&quot; call which is long, slow and loud.
But this sound was not like any I had ever heard.
I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything.
But, no luck.
I still kept hearing this low talking sound.
I had now totally given up weeding.
Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun.
But where was it coming from?
I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing.
Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats.
There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water.
I spotted them!
It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them.
They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish.
The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish.
I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour.
I felt very special that I got to see this.
It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.
One day Magneson took a walk in the park.
 He passed some trees and a pond.
 In the pond was a duck named George.
 George's wife was also in the pond.
 Her name was Nancy.
 Magneson walked over to the tree.
 Nancy flew up into the tree.
 She wanted to warn Magneson about the killer squirrel who lived inside of the tree.
 A few years before, the squirrel had thrown a chestnut at George and Nancy's son.
 He was knocked out, and the squirrel took him away.
 He was never seen again.
 Magneson asked what their son's name was.
 They said it was Leonard.
 But Magneson was only making small talk.
 He didn't believe the story about the killer squirrel.
 Even if there was one, there were many rocks by the pond that he could throw at the squirrel.
 He could also hide in the tall grass.
 George and Nancy were sorry to see that Magneson wouldn't listen.
 They flew away, singing a sad song.
 A short time later, the squirrel came out of the tree and threw a giant walnut at Magneson.
 No one ever saw Magneson again.
Every Monday morning, the little bad boy named Josh goes to school.
 Suddenly, little Josh slips on a banana skin ...
 - Ouch, says Josh, I fell on this and in addition I got a bump on the forehead!
 - Wonderful!
said the banana peel.
I am Mary.
I turned into banana skin after throwing trash on the school yard.
You have saved me and now I'm back to good old Mary.
What's your name?
 - Mine is Josh...
I'm a late to class ...
are you serious, where is the banana peel anyways?
 - The Banana, my dear Josh, was eaten by me, I threw the banana peel and turned into one ...
now you saved me, can you see the banana peel you slipped on around here?
 - No, you are right.
 - Mary said:  Josh, Thank you  - Excuse me, Mary ...
I have to go ...
Otherwise I'll be late for school ...
And I would not want to upset the teacher.
Once there was a young boy named Bret who had a cat named Wolfgang.
 The boy had really wanted a wolf for a pet, but his mother said wolves liked to hog the bathroom and liked to blow things down and they snored.
 So the boy had to call his cat Wolfie.
 He had also thought about naming his cat Sir Purrsalot.
 Bret himself planned to become a knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought Sir Purrsalot sounded like a good name for his brother knight.
 The difficulty there was that Wolfie didn't purr a lot.
 He purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot.
 Plus Bret's mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the bathroom and they clanked.
 So Bret was left with a cat named Wolfgang.
 The neighbors gave him strange looks when he stood in the front yard in the evening and yelled &quot;Wolfie!
 Here Wolfie!!!&quot;, to get Wolfgang to come in for the night.
 But Bret didn't care what anyone else thought.
 He had a Wolfie and maybe he'd end up becoming a pet doctor when he grew up instead.

Once upon a time, there was a dog named Puddles.
Puddles was lonely because he lived in an area where there were no other dogs, but only cats.
Day after day, Puddles would have to eat cat food and do cat things in order to fit in with the rest of his group.
He found it very boring and Puddles was sad.
Puddles didn't even look like a cat!
 All of the other cats teased Puddles.
&quot;You're too big,&quot; they said.
&quot;You've got too long of a nose!&quot; &quot;Why are you panting like that?&quot; Puddles knew that he was different.
 One day, Puddles chose to run away from all of the cats.
The cats laughed at him.
What a stupid dog!
Didn't he know that there were monsters in the woods that could eat him?
Puddles didn't care, because Puddles was sad enough to try.
 So Puddles packed up his things - his squeaky ball, his water dish, and his bone - and headed off into the woods.
He was finally happy!
All of a sudden, Puddles turned.
He smelled a funny smell.
It smelled like something he had never smelled before.
He turned around, and what did he see but another dog!
 Puddles was so happy, he barked with joy.
He went home with the other dog, who was named Mittens, and to his family.
Puddles was never lonely again.
Once upon a time there was a princess who lived in a high tower and she was not allowed to leave because of her mean mother.
One day she chose to leave but her mother would not let her.
The princess climbed out the window of the high tower and climbed down the south wall when her mother was sleeping.
She wandered out a good ways.
Finally she went into the forest where there are no electric poles but where there are some caves.
 There she met a young man who was running.
His name was John.
John asked the princess why such a beautiful woman like her was out in the middle of a forest.
She said that she had been trapped for her whole life by an evil woman who said she was her mother.
The man said that he would take the princess to a castle that was near.
He also said that he thought that she may be the missing princess.
As they go through the forest they run into many problems.
They see that they are lost and have no way of finding where to go.
After several days pass, the princess climbs up to the top of a tree in order to find out where they are.
She sees that the castle where they want to go is not that far away and near a mountain.
After thinking of the best way to get there, John and the princess go to the castle where they live for the rest of their lives.
